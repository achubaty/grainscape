## Grains of connectivity and minimum planar graph modelling of landscape connectivity

Given a landscape resistance surface, creates grains of connectivity and minimum planar graph models that can be used to calculate effective distances for landscape connectivity at multiple scales.
This is a cross-platform reimplementation of the `grainscape` package (https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/grainscape/).

### Installation
