version 0.3.0.9000
==================
* reimplement novel algorithm to calculate the minimum planar graph;
  no longer relies on SELES binary and is now cross-platform.
* use updated `igraph` functions internally
* updated vignette / tutorial (#5)
* Renamed functions to remove `gs` and `gsGOC` prefixes. Old names have been deprecated. (#10)

version 0.3
