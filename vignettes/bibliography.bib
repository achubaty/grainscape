abstract = {The growing awareness of the adverse effects of habitat fragmentation on natural systems has resulted in a rapidly increasing number of actions to reduce current fragmentation of natural systems as well as a growing demand for tools to predict and evaluate the effect of changes in the landscape on connectivity in the natural world. Recent studies used 'least-cost' modelling (available as a toolbox in GIS-systems) to calculate 'effective distance', a measure for distance modified with the cost to move between habitat patches based on detailed geographical information on the landscape as well as behavioural aspects of the organisms studied. We applied the method to a virtual landscape and a small scaled agricultural system subject to different scenarios in a land re-allotment project. We discuss the importance of technical aspects and ecological assumption underlying this modelling method. The model is shown to be a flexible tool to model functional connectivity in the study of the relation between landscape and mobility of organisms as well as in scenario building and evaluation in wild life protection projects and applied land management projects. Since 'effective distance' has the same units as Euclidean distance (m), this effective distance may be a straightforward way to include landscape and behavioural aspects in other models which include distance as a measure for isolation. We show the importance of the 'ecological' quality of the input maps and the choice of relevant landscape features and resistance values. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Hypothesis-testing methods for multivariate data are needed to make rigorous probability statements about the effects of factors and their interactions in experiments. Analysis of variance is particularly powerful for the analysis of univariate data. The traditional multivariate analogues, however, are too stringent in their assumptions for most ecological multivariate data sets. Non-parametric methods, based on permutation tests, are preferable. This paper describes a new non-parametric method for multivariate analysis of variance, after McArdle and Anderson (in press). It is given here, with several applications in ecology, to provide an alternative and perhaps more intuitive formulation for ANOVA (based on sums of squared distances) to complement the description provided by McArdle and Anderson (in press) for the analysis of any linear model. It is an improvement on previous non-parametric methods because it allows a direct additive partitioning of variation for complex models. It does this while maintaining the flexibility and lack of formal assumptions of other non-parametric methods. The test-statistic is a multivariate analogue to Fisher's F-ratio and is calculated directly from any symmetric distance or dissimilarity matrix. P-values are then obtained using permutations. Some examples of the method are given for tests involving several factors, including factorial and hierarchical (nested) designs and tests of interactions.},

abstract = {Landscape connectivity can be viewed from two perspectives that could be considered as extremes of a gradient: functional connectivity (refers to how the behavior of a dispersing organism is affected by landscape structure and elements) and structural connectivity (depends on the spatial configuration of habitat patches in the landscape like vicinity or presence of barriers). Here we argue that dispersal behavior changes with landscape configuration stressing the evolutionary dimension that has often been ignored in landscape ecology. Our working hypothesis is that the functional grain of resource patches in the landscape is a crucial factor shaping individual movements, and therefore influencing landscape connectivity. Such changes are likely to occur on the short-term (some generations). We review empirical studies comparing dispersal behavior in landscapes differing in their fragmentation level, i.e., with variable resource grain. We show that behavioral variation affecting each of the three stages of the dispersal process (emigration, displacement or transfer in the matrix, and immigration) is indeed likely to occur according to selective pressures resulting from changes in the grain of the landscape (mortality or deferred costs). Accordingly, landscape connectivity results from the interaction between the dispersal behavior of individuals and the grain of each particular landscape. The existence of this interaction requires that connectivity estimates (being based on individual-based models, least cost distance algorithms, and structural connectivity metrics or even Euclidian distance) should be carefully evaluated for their applicability with respect to the required level of precision in species-specific and landscape information.},

abstract = {Connectivity is classically considered an emergent property of landscapes encapsulating individuals' flows across space. However, its operational use requires a precise understanding of why and how organisms disperse. Such movements, and hence landscape connectivity, will obviously vary according to both organism properties and landscape features. We review whether landscape connectivity estimates could gain in both precision and generality by incorporating three fundamental outcomes of dispersal theory. Firstly, dispersal is a multi-causal process; its restriction to an 'escape reaction' to environmental unsuitability is an oversimplification, as dispersing individuals can leave excellent quality habitat patches or stay in poor-quality habitats according to the relative costs and benefits of dispersal and philopatry. Secondly, species, populations and individuals do not always react similarly to those cues that trigger dispersal, which sometimes results in contrasting dispersal strategies. Finally, dispersal is a major component of fitness and is thus under strong selective pressures, which could generate rapid adaptations of dispersal strategies. Such evolutionary responses will entail spatiotemporal variation in landscape connectivity. We thus strongly recommend the use of genetic tools to: (i) assess gene flow intensity and direction among populations in a given landscape; and (ii) accurately estimate landscape features impacting gene flow, and hence landscape connectivity. Such approaches will provide the basic data for planning corridors or stepping stones aiming at (re)connecting local populations of a given species in a given landscape. This strategy is clearly species- and landscape-specific. But we suggest that the ecological network in a given landscape could be designed by stacking up such linkages designed for several species living in different ecosystems. This procedure relies on the use of umbrella species that are representative of other species living in the same ecosystem.},

abstract = {Transportation infrastructures such as roads, railroads and canals can have major environmental impacts. Ecological road effects include the destruction and fragmentation of habitat, the interruption of ecological processes and increased erosion and pollution. Growing concern about these ecological road effects has led to the emergence of a new scientific discipline called road ecology. The goal of road ecology is to provide planners with scientific advice on how to avoid, minimize or mitigate negative environmental impacts of transportation. In this review, we explore the potential of molecular genetics to contribute to road ecology. First, we summarize general findings from road ecology and review studies that investigate road effects using genetic data. These studies generally focus only on barrier effects of roads on local genetic diversity and structure and only use a fraction of available molecular approaches. Thus, we propose additional molecular applications that can be used to evaluate road effects across multiple scales and dimensions of the biodiversity hierarchy. Finally, we make recommendations for future research questions and study designs that would advance molecular road ecology. Our review demonstrates that molecular approaches can substantially contribute to road ecology research and that interdisciplinary, long-term collaborations will be particularly important for realizing the full potential of molecular road ecology.},

abstract = {The goal of landscape genetics is to detect and explain landscape effects on genetic diversity and structure. Despite the increasing popularity of landscape genetic approaches, the statistical methods for linking genetic and landscape data remain largely untested. This lack of method evaluation makes it difficult to compare studies utilizing different statistics, and compromises the future development and application of the field. To investigate the suitability and comparability of various statistical approaches used in landscape genetics, we simulated data sets corresponding to five landscape-genetic scenarios. We then analyzed these data with eleven methods, and compared the methods based on their statistical power, type-1 error rates, and their overall ability to lead researchers to accurate conclusions about landscape-genetic relationships. Results suggest that some of the most commonly applied techniques (e.g. Mantel and partial Mantel tests) have high type-1 error rates, and that multivariate, non-linear methods are better suited for landscape genetic data analysis. Furthermore, different methods generally show only moderate levels of agreement. Thus, analyzing a data set with only one method could yield method-dependent results, potentially leading to erroneous conclusions. Based on these findings, we give recommendations for choosing optimal combinations of statistical methods, and identify future research needs for landscape genetic data analyses.},

abstract = {Individual-based clustering (IBC) methods have become increasingly popular for the characterization and delineation of genetic population units for numerous species. These methods delineate populations based on the genetic assumptions of a breeding unit which may provide a better representation of the behaviour of the species. The increasing use of IBC has resulted in the development of several analytical models all of which vary in their theoretical assumptions to infer genetic population structure. In this paper, we report a comparative strategy utilizing three IBC methods to characterize the spatial genetic structure of the boreal population of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) in central Canada. In addition, we implement both tests for isolation-by-distance (IBD) and frequency-based assignment tests to validate the consensus genetic clusters as defined by IBC. We also compare indirect metrics of genetic diversity and gene flow using both a priori defined herds and the IBC defined populations. Although our results show some concordance between both pre-defined herds and IBC derived genetic clusters, the IBC analyses identified a cluster that was cryptic to observation-based caribou herds and found no difference between several adjacent herds. By comparing multiple IBC methods and integrating both IBD and indirect genetic diversity metrics a posteriori, our strategy provides an effective means to delineate wildlife population structure and accurately assess genetic diversity and connectivity.},

The estimation of differentiation is c from Wright's F-ST and/or Slatkin's R-ST, an F-ST-analogue assuming a stepwise mutation model. Both these statistics have their drawbacks. Furthermore, there is no clear consensus over their relative accuracy. In this review, we first discuss the consequences of different temporal and spatial sampling strategies on differentiation estimation. Then, we move to statistical problems directly associated with the estimation of population structuring itself, with particular emphasis on the effects of high mutation rates and mutation patterns of microsatellite loci. Finally, we discuss the biological interpretation of population structuring estimates.},

abstract = {Least-cost models for focal species are widely used to design wildlife corridors. To evaluate the least-cost modeling approach used to develop 15 linkage designs in southern California, USA, we assessed robustness of the largest and least constrained linkage. Species experts parameterized models for eight species with weights for four habitat factors (land cover, topographic position, elevation, road density) and resistance values for each class within a factor (e. g., each class of land cover). Each model produced a proposed corridor for that species. We examined the extent to which uncertainty in factor weights and class resistance values affected two key conservation-relevant outputs, namely, the location and modeled resistance to movement of each proposed corridor. To do so, we compared the proposed corridor to 13 alternative corridors created with parameter sets that spanned the plausible ranges of biological uncertainty in these parameters. Models for five species were highly robust (mean overlap 88{\%}, little or no increase in resistance). Although the proposed corridors for the other three focal species overlapped as little as 0{\%} (mean 58{\%}) of the alternative corridors, resistance in the proposed corridors for these three species was rarely higher than resistance in the alternative corridors (mean difference was 0.025 on a scale of 1-10; worst difference was 0.39). As long as the model had the correct rank order of resistance values and factor weights, our results suggest that the predicted corridor is robust to uncertainty. The three carnivore focal species, alone or in combination, were not effective umbrellas for the other focal species. The carnivore corridors failed to overlap the predicted corridors of most other focal species and provided relatively high resistance for the other focal species (mean increase of 2.7 resistance units). Least-cost modelers should conduct uncertainty analysis so that decision-makers can appreciate the potential impact of model uncertainty on conservation decisions. Our approach to uncertainty analysis (which can be called a worst-case scenario approach) is appropriate for complex models in which distribution of the input parameters cannot be specified.},

Here we show that polymorphic microsatellites (primarily CA repeats) allow trees of human individuals to be constructed that reflect their geographic origin with remarkable accuracy. This is achieved by the analysis of a large number of loci for each individual, in spite of the small variations in allele frequencies existing between populations6,7. Reliable evolutionary relationships could also be established in comparisons among human populations but not among great ape species, probably because of constraints on allele length variation. Among human populations, diversity of microsatellites is highest in Africa, which is in contrast to other nuclear markers and supports the hypothesis of an African origin for humans.},

Regression of log-transformed data demonstrated that more variance in maximum dispersal distance could be explained by home range area (74{\%}) than could be explained by body size (50{\%}). The relationship between maximum dispersal distance and home range size was isometric (slope = 1) when the square root of home range area (i.e., linear dimension of home range) was used. Thus, maximum dispersal distance was related to home range size by a single constant of 40. A linear relationship remained between these two variables after the effects of body size were removed (F = 31.6, df = 1, 32, P = 3.2 X 10(-6), R-2 = 0.50). A similar isometric relationship with home range size was found for median dispersal distance (related by a multiple of 7). This isometric relationship between dispersal distance and home range size was tested using a second data source: maximum movements made by mammals after translocation, which also was linearly related to home range area (F = 94.5, df = 1, 23, P = 1.3 X 10(-9), R-2 = 0.81). The slope and intercept of this relationship were not different from those of the relationship between maximum dispersal distance and home range area. We suggest that the vagility of mammals affected both home range size and dispersal distance (or movement after translocation) independently of body size, such that these movements could be predicted by home range area better than by body size alone. The resulting isometric relationship between dispersal distance and home range size has potential as a useful scaling rule for ecological practitioners.},

This restricts the possibility of dispersal between sites, which for many species may be essential for long-term persistence. Here I describe iterative reserve selection algorithms which incorporate considerations of reserve connectivity and evaluate their performance using a data set for macroinvertebrates in ponds. Methods where spatial criteria were only invoked when ties between sites occurred did not perform significantly better than a simple greedy algorithm in terms of reserve connectivity. An algorithm based on a composite measure of species added and changes in reserve connectivity produced a reserve network with higher connectivity, but needed more sites to represent all species. A trade-off between connectivity and efficiency may be inevitable. but the costs in terms of efficiency may be justified if long-term persistence of species is more likely.

abstract = {Among the few universal themes in ecology is that resources, energy, and organisms themselves, are patchily distributed. This patchy distribution imposes a need for some level of dispersal or connectivity among spatially separate patches in order to allow organisms to acquire sufficient resources for survival. To date, general patterns of connectivity have not emerged. This is, in part, because different species respond to different scales of patchiness. I propose an extension of the graph-theoretic approach to control for such differences and reveal potential generalities about how natural populations are organized. Using statistical methods and simple applications of graph theory, continuum percolation, and metapopulation models, I demonstrate a pattern of hierarchical clustering among populations in both a plant-pathogen system at an extent of 1000 m and gene flow in a salamander species across a subcontinental range. Results suggest that some patches or populations. have a disproportionately high importance, to the maintenance of overall connectivity in the system within and across scales.},

Traditional studies of landscape connectivity have attempted to discern individual behavioral responses to landscape features, but this methodology is intractable for many species. This paper is an attempt to relate the components of landscape connectivity through the explicit treatment of their spatial and temporal scales. Traditional measures of structural and biological components of connectivity are reviewed and more recently developed methods for the analysis of scale for each are introduced. I then present a framework for the comparison of scalar phenomena based on Watt's unit pattern, describe the potential outcomes of the comparison and discuss the implications of each. Several testable hypotheses emerge from the analysis that may serve as a useful framework for the investigation of landscape connectivity in the future.},

abstract = {Quantitative methods for the design of reserve networks often select over-dispersed reserves, and consequently a number of species extinctions can be expected in such reserves, especially if unprotected surrounding habitat is lost. A novel approach that deals with this problem is presented by considering factors such as habitat quality and spatial configuration of reserves during the selection process. Species-specific effects of habitat loss and fragmentation, together with habitat composition, are taken into account when computing species probabilities of local occurrence. Sites are then chosen to represent all species with a given target probability. The method is applied to a dataset of butterflies and moths from the Creuddyn Peninsula, North Wales, UK, which includes species with various responses to habitat quality and configuration. The results show that the resulting level of reserve clustering will depend on the number of species for which the spatial configuration plays an important role (at the scale under consideration), and on the pattern and amount of habitat loss that is expected to follow around the reserves. The method represents a step towards taking better into account species persistence when selecting reserve networks in a changing world.},

abstract = {In view of the bewildering diversity of landscapes and possible patterns therein, our objectives were to see if a useful modeling method for directly comparing land mosaics could be developed based on graph theory, and whether basic spatial patterns could be identified that are common to diverse landscapes. The models developed were based on the spatial configuration of and interactions between landscape elements (ecosystems, land uses or ecotopes). Nodes represented landscape elements and linkages represented common boundaries between elements. Corridors, corridor intersections, and the matrix were successfully incorporated in the models. Twenty-five landscape graphs were constructed from aerial photographs chosen solely to represent a breadth of climates, land uses and human population densities. Seven distinctive clusters of nodes and linkages were identified and common, three of which, in the forms of a 'spider', 'necklace' and 'graph cell,' were in {\textgreater} 90{\%} of the graphs. These represented respectively the following 'configurations' of patches, corridors and matrix: (1) a matrix area surrounding or adjoining many patches; (2) a corridor bisecting a heterogeneous area; and (3) a unit in a network of intersecting corridors. The models also indicated that the connectivity or number of linkages for several common elements, such as fields and house clearings, was relatively constant across diverse landscapes, and that linear shaped elements such as roads and rivers were the most connected. Several additional uses of this graph modeling, including compatibility with systems dynamics models, are pinpointed. Thus the method is useful in allowing simple direct comparisons of any scale and any landscape to help identify patterns and principles. A focus on the common and uncommon configurations should enhance our understanding of fluxes across landscapes, and consequently the quality of land planning and management.},

abstract = {We introduce a Bayesian method for estimating hidden population substructure using multilocus molecular markers and geographical information provided by the sampling design. The joint posterior distribution of the substructure and allele frequencies of the respective populations is available in an analytical form when the number of populations is small, whereas an approximation based on a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation approach can be obtained for a moderate or large number of populations. Using the joint posterior distribution, posteriors can also be derived for any evolutionary population parameters, such as the traditional fixation indices. A major advantage compared to most earlier methods is that the number of populations is treated here as an unknown parameter. What is traditionally considered as two genetically distinct populations, either recently founded or connected by considerable gene flow, is here considered as one panmictic population with a certain probability based on marker data and prior information. Analyses of previously published data on the Moroccan argan tree (Argania spinosa) and of simulated data sets suggest that our method is capable of estimating a population substructure, while not artificially enforcing a substructure when it does not exist.

abstract = {Ecological relationships between patterns and processes are highly scale dependent. This paper reports the first formal exploration of how changing scale of research away from the scale of the processes governing gene flow affects the results of landscape genetic analysis. We used an individual-based, spatially explicit simulation model to generate patterns of genetic similarity among organisms across a complex landscape that would result given a stipulated landscape resistance model. We then evaluated how changes to the grain, extent, and thematic resolution of that landscape model affect the nature and strength of observed landscape genetic pattern-process relationships. We evaluated three attributes of scale including thematic resolution, pixel size, and focal window size. We observed large effects of changing thematic resolution of analysis from the stipulated continuously scaled resistance process to a number of categorical reclassifications. Grain and window size have smaller but statistically significant effects on landscape genetic analyses. Importantly, power in landscape genetics increases as grain of analysis becomes finer. The analysis failed to identify the operative grain governing the process, with the general pattern of stronger apparent relationship with finer grain, even at grains finer than the governing process. The results suggest that correct specification of the thematic resolution of landscape resistance models dominates effects of grain and extent. This emphasizes the importance of evaluating a range of biologically realistic resistance hypotheses in studies to associate landscape patterns to gene flow processes.},

abstract = {Graph theory is a powerful body of mathematical knowledge, based on simple concepts, in which structural units are depicted as nodes with relationships between them depicted as lines. The nodes may have qualitative and quantitative characteristics, and the edges may have properties such as weights and directions. Graph theory provides a flexible conceptual model that can clarify the relationship between structures and processes, including the mechanisms of configuration effects and compositional differences. Graph concepts apply to many ecological and evolutionary phenomena, including interspecific associations, spatial structure, dispersal in landscapes, and relationships within metapopulations and metacommunities. We review applications of graph theory in biology, emphasizing graphs with spatial contexts. We show how spatial graph properties can be used for description and comparison as well as to test specific hypotheses. We suggest that future applications should include explicit spatial elements for landscape studies of ecological, genetic and epidemiological phenomena.},

abstract = {Genetic monitoring has rarely been used for wildlife translocations despite the potential benefits this approach offers, compared to traditional field-based methods. We applied genetic monitoring to the reintroduced brown bear population in northern Italy. From 2002 to 2008, 2781 hair and faecal samples collected noninvasively plus 12 samples obtained from captured or dead bears were used to follow the demographic and geographical expansion and changes in genetic composition. Individual genotypes were used to reconstruct the wild pedigree and revealed that the population increased rapidly, from nine founders to {\textgreater} 27 individuals in 2008 (lambda = 1.17-1.19). Spatial mapping of bear samples indicated that most bears were distributed in the region surrounding the translocation site; however, individual bears were found up to 163 km away. Genetic diversity in the population was high, with expected heterozygosity of 0.74-0.79 and allelic richness of 4.55-5.41. However, multi-year genetic monitoring data showed that mortality rates were elevated, immigration did not occur, one dominant male sired all cubs born from 2002 to 2005, genetic diversity declined, relatedness increased, inbreeding occurred, and the effective population size was extremely small (Ne = 3.03, ecological method). The comprehensive information collected through genetic monitoring is critical for implementing future conservation plans for the brown bear population in the Italian Alps. This study provides a model for other reintroduction programmes by demonstrating how genetic monitoring can be implemented to uncover aspects of the demography, ecology and genetics of small and reintroduced populations that will advance our understanding of the processes influencing their viability, evolution, and successful restoration.},

abstract = {Rapid encroachment on woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) habitat by resource extraction industries toil, gas, forestry, and peat) is occurring throughout northern Alberta, Canada. The effect of this human development on the movement and distribution of threatened woodland caribou remains poorly understood. We captured and fitted 36 woodland caribou with Global Positioning System (GPS) collars. These yielded 43,415 locations during the 12-month study period. We tested the hypothesis that woodland caribou use areas adjacent to wellsites, roads, and seismic lines as often as thc) use areas away fi om these developments. We analyzed caribou locations, controlling for vegetation cover classes to remove confounding effects of habitat, and grouped to examine seasonal variation in distribution. Caribou avoided human developments: the level of avoidance appeared to be related to the level of human activity in the stud) area. We recorded maximum avoidance distances of 1,000 m (wells) and 250 m (roads and seismic lines). By extrapolating avoidance distances to the entire study area, we calculated that 22-48{\%} of our study area would receive reduced use by caribou. Avoidance effects were highest during late winter and calving and lowest during summer, possibly as a result of lower traffic levels then. We propose management strategies to balance caribou conservation with resource extraction in northern Alberta.},

These features may act as barriers to the movement of threatened woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou). Thirty-six woodland caribou were captured and fitted with global positioning system collars. These collared caribou yielded 43 415 locations during the 12-month study period. We compared rates of crossing roads and seismic lines with rates at which caribou crossed simulated roads and seismic lines created using ArcInfo GIS. Seismic lines were not barriers to caribou movements, whereas roads with moderate vehicle traffic acted as semipermeable barriers to caribou movements. The greatest barrier effects were evident during late winter, when caribou crossed actual roads 6 times less frequently than simulated road networks. Semipermeable barrier effects may exacerbate functional habitat loss demonstrated through avoidance behaviour. This novel approach represents an important development in the burgeoning field of road ecology and has great potential for use in validating animal-movement models.},

abstract = {Spatial structure of genetic variation within populations is well measured by statistics based on the distribution of pairs of individual genotypes, and various such statistics have been widely used in experimental studies. However, the problem of uncharacterized correlations among statistics for different alleles has limited the applications of multiallelic, multilocus summary measures, since these had unknown sampling distributions. Usually multiple alleles and/or multiple loci are required in order to precisely measure spatial structures, and to provide precise indirect estimates of the amount of dispersal in samples of reasonable size. This article examines the correlations among pair-wise statistics, including Moran I-statistics and various measures of conditional kinship, for different alleles of a locus. First the correlations are mathematically derived for random spatial distributions, which allow averages over alleles and loci to be used as more powerful yet exact test statistics for the null hypothesis. Then extensive computer simulations are conducted to examine the correlations among values for different alleles under isolation by distance processes. For loci with more than three alleles, the results show that the correlations are remarkably and perhaps surprisingly small, establishing the principle that then alleles behave as nearly independent realizations of space time stochastic processes. The results also show that the correlations are largely robust with respect to the degree of spatial structure, and they can be used in a straightforward manner to form confidence intervals for averages. The results allow a precise connection between observations in experimental studies and levels of dispersal in theoretical models. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Least-cost modelling has become a popular method for measuring connectivity. By representing the landscape as a cost-surface, least-cost paths can be calculated that represent the route of maximum efficiency between two locations as a function of the distance travelled and the costs traversed. Both the length and the accumulated-cost of a least-cost path have been used as measures of connectivity between pairs of locations. However, we are concerned that in some situations the length of a least-cost path may provide a misleading measure of connectivity as it only accounts for the distance travelled while ignoring the costs traversed, and results in a measure that may be little better than Euclidean distance. Through simulations using fractal landscapes we demonstrate that least-cost path length is often highly correlated with Euclidean distance. This indicates that least-cost path length provides a poor measure of connectivity in many situations, as it does not capture sufficient information about the ecological costs to movement represented by the cost-surface. We recommend that in most situations the accumulated-cost of a least-cost path provides a more appropriate measure of connectivity between locations as it accounts for both the distance travelled and costs traversed, and that the generation of vector least-cost paths should be reserved for visualisation purposes.},

abstract = {I reviewed and reconciled predictions of four models oil the effect of habitat fragmentation on the population extinction threshold, and I compared these predictions to results, from empirical studies. All four models predict that habitat fragmentation call, under some conditions, increase the extinction threshold such that, in more fragmented landscapes, more habitat is required for population persistence. However, empirical studies have shown both positive and negative effects of habitat fragmentation on population abundance and distribution with about equal frequency, suggesting that the models lack some important process(es). The two colonization-extinction (CE) models predict that fragmentation call increase the extinction threshold by up to 60-80{\%}; i.e., the amount of habitat required for persistence can shift from {\textless}5{\%} of the landscape to {\textgreater}80{\%} of the landscape, with a shift from completely clumped to completely fragmented habitat. The other two models (birth-immigration-death-emigration, or BIDE models) predict much smaller potential effects or fragmentation oil the extinction threshold, of no more than a 10-20{\%} shift in the amount of habitat required for persistence. This difference has important implications, for conservation. If fragmentation can have a large effect on the extinction threshold, then alteration of habitat pattern (independent of habitat amount) call be all effective tool for conservation. On the other hand, if the effects of fragmentation on the extinction threshold are small, then this is a limited option, I suggest that the difference in model predictions results from differences in the mechanisms by which the models produce the extinction threshold. In the CE models, the threshold occurs by an assumed reduction in colonization rate with decreasing habitat amount. In the BIDE models, loss of habitat is assumed to increase the proportion of the population that spends time in the matrix, where reproduction is not possible and the mortality rate is assumed to be higher (than in breeding habitat). Habitat loss therefore decreases the overall reproduction rate and increases the overall mortality rate on the landscape. I hypothesize that this imposes a constraint on the potential for habitat fragmentation to mitigate effects of habitat loss in BIDE models. To date, empirical studies of the independent effects of habitat loss and fragmentation suggest that habitat has a much larger effect than habitat fragmentation on the distribution and abundance of birds, supporting the BIDE model prediction, at least for this taxon.},

abstract = {If conservation efforts are to be successful, it is critical that we understand the relationship between habitat loss and the probability of population extinction. Available evidence suggests a threshold amount of habitat loss at which the probability of population extinction increases from near-zero to near-one following a small additional loss of habitat. The main factors thought to determine this extinction threshold are reproductive rate of the organism, rate of emigration of the organism from habitat, habitat pattern in the landscape (fragmentation), and matrix quality (survival rate of the organism in non-habitat areas). Effective conservation measures require knowledge not only of what factors determine the threshold, but also the relative magnitudes of their effects. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the relative effects of these four factors on the extinction threshold, using a spatially-explicit simulation model. Reproductive rate had the largest potential effect on the extinction threshold. The rate of emigration from habitat also had a very strong predicted effect on the extinction threshold; the higher the rate of emigration, the more habitat was needed for persistence. Matrix quality had a moderate effect, and habitat pattern had a very small predicted effect. The simulations predicted that under certain circumstances up to 58{\%} less habitat is required for population persistence, if a matrix of very low quality is converted to a matrix of very high quality. Matrix quality can be improved by maintaining heterogeneous landscapes with a diversity of vegetated features, and by reducing factors causing direct mortality of dispersers such as road traffic and pesticides. In summary, the simulations suggest that (i) the first priority for conservation should be habitat preservation and restoration, (ii) information on movement rates of organisms is critical for predicting extinction thresholds and (iii) conservation strategies should consider the quality of the whole landscape, including the matrix.

abstract = {Gaining insight into the dynamic nature of landscapes often involves the use of simulation models to explore potential changes over long time frames and extensive spatial areas. However, bridging the gap between conceptual models of landscape dynamics and their simulation on a computer can lead to many pitfalls. If implemented using a general-purpose programming language, the underlying model becomes hidden in the details of the computer code, making it difficult to compare the conceptual and implemented models, and to modify the model. Alternatively, previously built models may contain hidden assumptions and have limited adaptability. Domain-specific languages have been developed in a number of areas to facilitate the construction of models at a level closer to the conceptual model, thereby making model implementation more accessible to domain experts. Such tools to support modelling in the domain of landscape ecology can achieve a balance between the flexibility of programming and the structure and ease of using pre-built models. One of the goals of SELES (Spatially Explicit Landscape Event Simulator) has been to create a language for modelling landscape dynamics that provides ecologists and planners with an appropriate tool to address some of the problems that arise in model development. Our high-level, structured language separates the specification of model behaviour from the mechanics of its implementation, freeing landscape modellers from programming and allowing them to focus on the underlying model. This language is declarative and thus permits a clear representation of the conceptual model, which the,SELES engine converts into a computer simulation of landscape change. Our structured framework guides the development of a broad class of spatio-temporal landscape models by aiding model prototyping, modification, verification, comparison, and re-use.

abstract = {Well-founded methods to assess habitat connectivity are essential to inform land management decisions that include conservation and restoration goals. Indeed, to be able to develop a conservation plan that maintains animal movement through a fragmented landscape, spatial locations of habitat and paths among them need to be represented. Graph-based approaches have been proposed to determine paths among habitats at various scales and dispersal movement distances, and balance data requirements with information content. Conventional graphs, however, do not explicitly maintain geographic reference, reducing communication capacity and utility of other geo-spatial information. We present spatial graphs as a unifying theory for applying graph-based methods in a geographic context. Spatial graphs integrate a geometric reference system that ties patches and paths to specific spatial locations and spatial dimensions. Arguably, the complete graph, with paths between every pair of patches, may be one of the most relevant graphs from an ecosystem perspective, but it poses challenges to compute, process and visualize. We developed Minimum Planar Graphs as a spatial generalization of Delaunay triangulations to provide a reasonable approximation of complete graphs that facilitates visualization and comprehension of the network of connections across landscapes. If, as some authors have suggested, the minimum spanning tree identifies the connectivity "backbone" of a landscape, then the Minimum Planar Graph identifies the connectivity "network". We applied spatial graphs, and in particular the Minimum Planar Graph, to analyze woodland caribou habitat in Manitoba, Canada to support the establishment of a national park.},

abstract = {The mountain pine beetle (MPB) epidemic in British Columbia and western Alberta has affected vast areas, and poses a threat to Jack Pine stands in the boreal forests of northern Alberta and Saskatchewan. Understanding the potential pathways and relative likelihood of attack for stands is important for strategic and tactical management decisions. Landscape-scale connectivity analysis can provide information at broad spatial scales to help quantify risk and is a useful method even in areas with no current attack or low recent attack. Connectivity is defined as the degree to which pattern impedes or facilitates movement (Taylor et al. 1993). Assessing connectivity of habitat for species of concern at the landscape scale is becoming a key tool for land-use planning and land management (Manseau et al. 2002). In the case of forest pests, the goal is to reduce connectivity, and hence landscape-scale susceptibility. To do this requires methods to identify areas of high susceptibility that also have high connectivity with other susceptible patches, in particular patches with current MPB attack. We applied and refined a set of landscape analysis methods to assess connectivity of high susceptibility patches across provincial scale regions at relatively fine scales (1 ha resolution) based on the techniques described in Keitt et al. (1997) and Fall et al. (2007). This analysis helps to identify the scales at which habitat patches become connected, important links/ corridors, as well as the relative likelihood of attack. The methods we applied considers distance as measured in Euclidean (straight-line) space or in "movement cost" (least-cost) space where a unit of movement may be higher/lower cost depending on the presence of barriers (Bunn et al. 2000). For example, relative to late-seral pine forest, lakes and unsuitable hosts may have higher dispersal impedance for MPB than mid-seral pine stands and mixed species stands. In this analysis we differentiate cost based on susceptibility. We also developed and applied preliminary methods to assess directional impacts of prevailing wind. Due to the high density of susceptible hosts in western Alberta, and their proximity to current MPB attack, previous results of connectivity analyses tended to provide information most relevant to Alberta. In the present analysis, we aimed to also provide information of higher utility for Saskatchewan, focusing analysis and outputs where possible onto patterns of hosts in Saskatchewan.},

abstract = {Landscape modification and habitat fragmentation are key drivers of global species loss. Their effects may be understood by focusing on: (1) individual species and the processes threatening them, and (2) human-perceived landscape patterns and their correlation with species and assemblages. Individual species may decline as a result of interacting exogenous and endogenous threats, including habitat loss, habitat degradation, habitat isolation, changes in the biology, behaviour, and interactions of species, as well as additional, stochastic threats. Human-perceived landscape patterns that are frequently correlated with species assemblages include the amount and structure of native vegetation, the prevalence of anthropogenic edges, the degree of landscape connectivity, and the structure and heterogeneity of modified areas. Extinction cascades are particularly likely to occur in landscapes with low native vegetation cover, low landscape connectivity, degraded native vegetation and intensive land use in modified areas, especially if keystone species or entire functional groups of species are lost. This review (1) demonstrates that species-oriented and pattern-oriented approaches to understanding the ecology of modified landscapes are highly complementary, (2) clarifies the links between a wide range of interconnected themes, and (3) provides clear and consistent terminology. Tangible research and management priorities are outlined that are likely to benefit the conservation of native species in modified landscapes around the world.},

abstract = {Background: Understanding the role of seascape in shaping genetic and demographic population structure is highly challenging for marine pelagic species such as cetaceans for which there is generally little evidence of what could effectively restrict their dispersal. In the present work, we applied a combination of recent individual-based landscape genetic approaches to investigate the population genetic structure of a highly mobile extensive range cetacean, the harbour porpoise in the eastern North Atlantic, with regards to oceanographic characteristics that could constrain its dispersal. Results: Analyses of 10 microsatellite loci for 752 individuals revealed that most of the sampled range in the eastern North Atlantic behaves as a 'continuous' population that widely extends over thousands of kilometres with significant isolation by distance (IBD). However, strong barriers to gene flow were detected in the south-eastern part of the range. These barriers coincided with profound changes in environmental characteristics and isolated, on a relatively small scale, porpoises from Iberian waters and on a larger scale porpoises from the Black Sea. Conclusion: The presence of these barriers to gene flow that coincide with profound changes in oceanographic features, together with the spatial variation in IBD strength, provide for the first time strong evidence that physical processes have a major impact on the demographic and genetic structure of a cetacean. This genetic pattern further suggests habitat-related fragmentation of the porpoise range that is likely to intensify with predicted surface ocean warming.},

abstract = {1. The ecological footprint of a road may extend for several kilometres with overlapping effects from neighbouring roads causing a nonlinear accumulation of road effects in the landscape. Availability of preferred habitat, spatial dependencies between roads and habitat types, and fidelity to traditionally used areas further confound our ability to predict population-level responses of animals to growing road networks. 2. To isolate these effects, we developed an individually based movement model using elk Cervus elaphus L. as a model system. Empirically derived movement rules redistributed elk under different amounts of preferred habitat (clearcuts), road densities, and road development schemes. We tracked potential mortality risk (given time spent near roads) and emigration rates (given declining accessibility of foraging habitat). 3. Design of the road network accounted for up to 30-55{\%} difference in mortality risk and emigration rates, with the largest differences occurring at intermediate road densities (1-1.5 km km(-2)) when road effects began to saturate the landscape. Maintaining roads in association with clearcuts caused a decline in habitat accessibility equivalent to replacing 50-75{\%} of these foraging patches with conifer forest. A nine-fold difference in potential emigration was observed after varying elk tolerance for declining habitat accessibility despite holding local movement biases constant. 4. Elk responses to growing road networks were non-linear, exposing thresholds for road density that were reflected in the home range occupancy patterns of a large sample of elk in the region. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our approach provides a means of scaling-up complex movement decisions to population-level redistribution, separating the confounding effects of landscape context from road effects, and exposing thresholds in connectivity and mortality risks for wildlife caused by infrastructure growth. Our model indicated that road densities {\textless}= 0.5 km km(-2) yielded the highest probability of elk occurrence where elk were hunted (and sensitive to roads), but disassociating roads from foraging habitats or managing human access to roads may maintain effective elk habitat at substantially higher road densities.},

abstract = {The influence of landscape features on the movement of an organism between two point locations is often measured as an effective distance. Typically, raster models of landscape resistance are used to calculate effective distance. Because organisms may experience landscape heterogeneity at different scales (i.e. functional grains), using a raster with too fine or too coarse a spatial grain (i.e. analysis grain) may lead to inaccurate estimates of effective distance. We adopted a simulation approach where the true functional grain and effective distance for a theoretical organism were defined and the analysis grains of landscape connectivity models were systematically changed. We used moving windows and grains of connectivity, a recently introduced landscape graph method that uses an irregular tessellation of the resistance surface to coarsen the landscape data. We then used least-cost path metrics to measure effective distance and found that matching the functional and analysis grain sizes was most accurate at recovering the expected effective distance, affirming the importance of multi-scale analysis. Moving window scaling with a maximum function (win.max) performed well when the majority of landscape structure influencing connectivity consisted of high resistance features. Moving window scaling with a minimum function (win.min) performed well when the relevant landscape structure consisted of low resistance regions. The grains of connectivity method performed well under all scenarios, avoiding an a priori choice of window function, which may be challenging in complex landscapes. Appendices are provided that demonstrate the use of grains of connectivity models.},

abstract = {Landscape change may reduce the connectivity of landscapes and impact the movement of animals. If movement processes have been influenced by landscape connectivity, we hypothesize that animals may distribute themselves in larger connected regions of the landscape in order to minimize the movement costs associated with obtaining required resources and avoiding predators. We adopt the term functional grain to describe a set of functionally connected regions. In this spatial pattern, each region describes a contiguous area of the landscape within which an animal may move freely below a threshold amount of movement cost. We used telemetry data from woodland caribou Rangifer tarandus caribou to test hypothetical functional grains where connectivity was determined by the spatial configuration of resource patches (patch only), by the resistance to movement presented by landscape features (resistance only), and by a combination of the two (patch + resistance). To identify these functional grains, we used a grains of connectivity approach, and introduced a novel lattice-based variant of this method to build the resistance only model. We developed a measure of fit that describes caribou distribution with respect to larger functionally connected regions in the grain, and used this to ask: 1) are seasonal caribou locations consistent with a random functional grain, implying that landscape connectivity has not shaped their distribution? 2) Given a functional grain model, are seasonal caribou locations distributed in larger functionally connected regions than random points, implying a response to the shape, size, and location of the connected regions. We found support for landscape connectivity influencing animal distribution using grains based on a landscape resistance model, and that support varied between behaviourally defined seasons. We also discuss how our novel lattice approach may be valuable for highly mobile mammals and other species where the identification of resource patches is a limitation.},

abstract = {Landscape genetic analyses are typically conducted at one spatial scale. Considering multiple scales may be essential for identifying landscape features influencing gene flow. We examined landscape connectivity for woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) at multiple spatial scales using a new approach based on landscape graphs that creates a Voronoi tessellation of the landscape. To illustrate the potential of the method, we generated five resistance surfaces to explain how landscape pattern may influence gene flow across the range of this population. We tested each resistance surface using a raster at the spatial grain of available landscape data (200 m grid squares). We then used our method to produce up to 127 additional grains for each resistance surface. We applied a causal modelling framework with partial Mantel tests, where evidence of landscape resistance is tested against an alternative hypothesis of isolation-by-distance, and found statistically significant support for landscape resistance to gene flow in 89 of the 507 spatial grains examined. We found evidence that major roads as well as the cumulative effects of natural and anthropogenic disturbance may be contributing to the genetic structure. Using only the original grid surface yielded no evidence for landscape resistance to gene flow. Our results show that using multiple spatial grains can reveal landscape influences on genetic structure that may be overlooked with a single grain, and suggest that coarsening the grain of landcover data may be appropriate for highly mobile species. We discuss how grains of connectivity and related analyses have potential landscape genetic applications in a broad range of systems.},

abstract = {We investigated the relationships among landscape quality, gene flow, and population genetic structure of fishers ( Martes pennanti) in ON, Canada. We used graph theory as an analytical framework considering each landscape as a network node. The 34 nodes were connected by 93 edges. Network structure was characterized by a higher level of clustering than expected by chance, a short mean path length connecting all pairs of nodes, and a resiliency to the loss of highly connected nodes. This suggests that alleles can be efficiently spread through the system and that extirpations and conservative harvest are not likely to affect their spread. Two measures of node centrality were negatively related to both the proportion of immigrants in a node and node snow depth. This suggests that central nodes are producers of emigrants, contain high-quality habitat (i.e., deep snow can make locomotion energetically costly) and that fishers were migrating from high to low quality habitat. A method of community detection on networks delineated five genetic clusters of nodes suggesting cryptic population structure. Our analyses showed that network models can provide system-level insight into the process of gene flow with implications for understanding how landscape alterations might affect population fitness and evolutionary potential.},

abstract = {DNA from remotely-collected samples of hair or feces provides a means of assessing attributes of populations of wild animals, including genetic diversity, spatial distribution, patterns of habitat use, dispersal distances, population fragmentation, and population size. This technique has been called noninvasive genetic sampling, a term in common usage especially in the bear literature. It has taken on the connotation of being more humane than techniques such as radiotelemetry that require capture of animals. The term noninvasive, however, is misapplied: in the biological-genetic sense, it refers only to the invasion of the body (through the skin or an orifice), not to capture or general intrusiveness. If it is construed to mean nonintrusive in a more general sense, then other methods of collecting population data that do not require animal capture, such as camera trapping, sign surveys, sightings, and interviews, should be called noninvasive as well. Moreover, once an animal is radiocollared, the process of collecting telemetry data is also noninvasive. I recommend the use of a more neutral and also more informative and technically correct term, "remote," to describe genetic and other forms of sampling that do not involve human handling of animals. Remote sampling aids investigators in reducing their effects on the study subjects and also may provide larger samples than can be obtained by trapping. However, many of the important biological questions that can be (and for {\textgreater} 30 years have been) studied by capturing animals and tracking them telemetrically cannot be addressed with genetic or other remote sampling techniques.},

Researchers have concentrated particularly on a few properties that seem to be common to many networks: the small-world property, power-law degree distributions, and network transitivity. In this article, we highlight another property that is found in many networks, the property of community structure, in which network nodes are joined together in tightly knit groups, between which there are only looser connections. We propose a method for detecting such communities, built around the idea of using centrality indices to find community boundaries. We test our method on computer-generated and real-world graphs whose community structure is already known and find that the method detects this known structure with high sensitivity and reliability. We also apply the method to two networks whose community structure is not well known-a collaboration network and a food web-and find that it detects significant and informative community divisions in both cases.},

The model can be used for analysis of population substructure, and is particularly focused on relating genetic correlation to measurable covariates. The approach is intended for cases when the existence of subpopulations is uncertain and a priori assignment of samples to hypothesized subpopulations is difficult. Such a situation arises, for example, with western Arctic bowhead whales, where genetic samples are available only from a possibly mixed migratory assemblage. We estimate genetic structure associated with spatial, temporal, or other variables that may confound the detection of population structure. In the bowhead case, the model permits detection of genetic patterns associated with a temporally pulsed multi-population assemblage in the annual migration. Hypothesis tests for population substructure and for covariate effects can be carried out using permutation methods. Simulated and real examples illustrate the effectiveness and reliability of the approach and enable comparisons with other familiar approaches. Analysis of the bowhead data finds no evidence for two temporally pulsed subpopulations using the best available data, although a significant pattern found by other researchers using preliminary data is also confirmed here.},

abstract = {Evaluating fine-scale population structure of multiple species in the same landscape increases our ability to identify common patterns as well as discern ecological differences among species' landscape genetic relationships. In the Palouse bioregion of northern Idaho, USA, 99{\%} of the native prairie has been converted to nonirrigated agriculture and exotic grasslands. Columbia spotted frogs (Rana luteiventris) and long-toed salamanders (Ambystoma macrodactylum) in this area breed almost entirely in artificial ponds on private land. We used genetic distances (F-ST and D-c) derived from eight microsatellite loci in 783 samples to evaluate the relationships among sympatric breeding populations (N = 20 and 26) of these species in a 213-km2 landscape. Both species showed a pattern of isolation by distance that was not improved when distance was measured along drainages instead of topographically corrected straight lines (P {\textless} 0.01). After testing for autocorrelation among genetic distances, we used an information theoretic approach to model landscape resistance based on slope, soil type, solar insolation, and land cover, and multi-model inference to rank the resistance of landscape surfaces to dispersal (represented by genetic distance). For both species, urban and rural developed land cover provided the highest landscape resistances. Resistance values for long-toed salamanders followed a moisture gradient where forest provided the least resistance, while agriculture and shrub/clearcut provided the least resistance for Columbia spotted frogs. Comparative landscape genetics can be a powerful tool for detecting similarities and differences between codistributed species, and resulting models can be used to predict species-specific responses to landscape change.},

The search for general principles underlying the internal organization of such systems often uses bottom-up simulation models such as cellular automata and agent-based models. No general framework for designing, testing, and analyzing bottom-up models has yet been established, but recent advances in ecological modeling have come together in a general strategy we call pattern-oriented modeling. This strategy provides a unifying framework for decoding the internal organization of agent-based complex systems and may lead toward unifying algorithmic theories of the relation between adaptive behavior and system complexity.},

abstract = {Landscape genetics is a new discipline that aims to provide information oil how landscape and environmental features influence population genetic structure. The first key step of landscape genetics is the spatial detection and location of genetic discontinuities between populations. However, efficient methods for achieving this task are lacking. In this article, we first clarify what is conceptually involved in the spatial modeling of genetic data. Then we describe a Bayesian model implemented in a Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme that allows inference of the location of such genetic discontinuities from individual georeferenced multilocus genotypes, without a priori knowledge on populational units and limits. In this method, the global set of sampled individuals is modeled as a spatial mixture of panmictic populations, and the spatial organization of populations is modeled through the colored Voronoi tessellation. In addition to spatially locating genetic discontinuities, the method quantifies the amount of spatial dependence in the data set, estimates the number of Populations in the studied area, assigns individuals to their population of origin, and detects individual migrants between populations, while taking into account uncertainty on the location of sampled individuals. The performance of the method is evaluated through the analysis of simulated data sets. Results show good performances for standard data sets (e.g., 100 individuals genotyped at 10 loci with 10 alleles per locus), With high but also low levels of population differentiation (e.g., F-ST {\textless} 0.05). The method is then applied to a set of 88 individuals of wolverines (Gulo gulo) sampled in the northwestern United States and genotyped at 10 microsatellites.},

abstract = {In noninvasive genetic sampling, when genotyping error rates are high and recapture rates are low, misidentification of individuals can lead to overestimation of population size. Thus, estimating genotyping errors is imperative. Nonetheless, conducting multiple polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) at multiple loci is time-consuming and costly. To address the controversy regarding the minimum number of PCRs required for obtaining a consensus genotype, we compared consumer-style the performance of two genotyping protocols (multiple-tubes and 'comparative method') in respect to genotyping success and error rates. Our results from 48 faecal samples of river otters (Lontra canadensis) collected in Wyoming in 2003, and from blood samples of five captive river otters amplified with four different primers, suggest that use of the comparative genotyping protocol can minimize the number of PCRs per locus. For all but five samples at one locus, the same consensus genotypes were reached with fewer PCRs and with reduced error rates with this protocol compared to the multiple-tubes method. This finding is reassuring because genotyping errors can occur at relatively high rates even in tissues such as blood and hair. In addition, we found that loci that amplify readily and yield consensus genotypes, may still exhibit high error rates (7-32{\%}) and that amplification with different primers resulted in different types and rates of error. Thus, assigning a genotype based on a single PCR for several loci could result in misidentification of individuals. We recommend that programs designed to statistically assign consensus genotypes should be modified to allow the different treatment of heterozygotes and homozygotes intrinsic to the comparative method.},

Synthesis and applications. Before investing in connectivity projects, conservation practitioners should analyse the benefits expected to arise from increasing connectivity and compare them with alternative investments, to ensure as much biodiversity conservation and resilience to climate change as possible within their budget. Strategies that we expect to remain robust in the face of climate change include maintaining and increasing the area of high quality habitats, prioritizing areas that have high environmental heterogeneity and controlling other anthropogenic threatening processes.},

abstract = {This study investigates the impact of past and present landscape structure on the current genetic structure of the bush-cricket Metrioptera roeseli (Orthoptera, Tettigoniidae) in a rural landscape in Germany. Assuming that land-use types, such as grassland, arable land and forest, as well as linear structures, mainly roads, differentially affect the connectivity of the bush-cricket's habitat and therefore migration and gene flow, we correlated landscape parameters between sampling locations as derived from GIS-maps with genetic similarities between individual bush-crickets as estimated by RAPD-PCR. Fifty bush-crickets were sampled with distances between sampling locations varying between 15 m and 2 km. Corresponding landscape configurations were recorded in 8 years between 1945 and 1998. Landscape configuration 50 years ago appeared to have influenced the present genetic structure of the bush-cricket (R-2 = 0.18). Crossing roads and land use other than grassland along the transect between sampling locations tended to decrease genetic similarity, whereas grassland and parallel roads tended to increase genetic similarity between bush-crickets. Following shifts in land use during 1953-1973 the correlation between landscape and present genetic structure decreased gradually. Our study suggests that it needs time for the landscape to build a visible effect on the genetic structure of the bush-cricket population, and that this effect cannot be detected if the landscape changes faster than the genetic structure responds to it.},

CPC was developed as a method of data surnmarization, but frequently biologists would like to use the method to detect analogous patterns of trait correlation in multiple populations or species. To investigate the properties of CPC, we simulated data that reflect a set of causal factors. The CPC method performs as expected from a statistical point of view, but often gives results that are contrary to biological intuition. In general, CPC tends to underestimate the degree of structure that matrices share. Differences of trait variances and covariances due to a difference in a single causal factor in two otherwise identically structured datasets often cause CPC to declare the two datasets unrelated. Conversely, CPC could identify datasets as having the same structure when causal factors are different. Reordering of vectors before analysis can aid in the detection of patterns. We urge caution in the biological interpretation of CPC analysis results.},

abstract = {Background: Many studies in evolutionary biology and genetics are limited by the rate at which phenotypic information can be acquired. The wings of Drosophila species are a favorable target for automated analysis because of the many interesting questions in evolution and development that can be addressed with them, and because of their simple structure. Results: We have developed an automated image analysis system (WINGMACHINE) that measures the positions of all the veins and the edges of the wing blade of Drosophilid flies. A video image is obtained with the aid of a simple suction device that immobilizes the wing of a live fly. Low-level processing is used to find the major intersections of the veins. High-level processing then optimizes the fit of an a priori B-spline model of wing shape. WINGMACHINE allows the measurement of 1 wing per minute, including handling, imaging, analysis, and data editing. The repeatabilities of 12 vein intersections averaged 86{\%} in a sample of flies of the same species and sex. Comparison of 2400 wings of 25 Drosophilid species shows that wing shape is quite conservative within the group, but that almost all taxa are diagnosably different from one another. Wing shape retains some phylogenetic structure, although some species have shapes very different from closely related species. The WINGMACHINE system facilitates artificial selection experiments on complex aspects of wing shape. We selected on an index which is a function of 14 separate measurements of each wing. After 14 generations, we achieved a 15 S. D. difference between up and down-selected treatments. Conclusion: WINGMACHINE enables rapid, highly repeatable measurements of wings in the family Drosophilidae. Our approach to image analysis may be applicable to a variety of biological objects that can be represented as a framework of connected lines.},

abstract = {In northeastern Alberta, Canada, continued expansion of the oil and gas industry along with timber harvesting has raised concerns that the resulting environmental changes may negatively affect the woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) population in this region. Caribou are a threatened species in Alberta, and populations in northeastern Alberta appear to be stable or slightly decreasing. The spatial distribution of caribou in relation to alternative prey (commonly moose [Aloes aloes]) has been hypothesized to affect the level of wolf (Canis lupus) predation on caribou populations. We monitored radiomarked caribou, moose, and wolves between 1993 and 1997, and we found that selection of fen/bog complexes by caribou and selection of well-drained habitats by moose and wolves resulted in spatial separation. This spatial separation in turn reduced wolf predation pressure on caribou but did not provide a total refuge from wolves. Any management activities that. increase the density of moose and wolves or increase access of wolves into fen/bog complexes will likely reduce the refuge effect provided by large fen/bog complexes.},

abstract = {We assessed the response of woodland caribou (Rang fer tarandus caribou) to land-cover type, predation risk, energetic costs of movement, and patch configuration at multiple spatial scales. We applied a nonlinear model to frequent locations collected with Global Positioning System (GPS) collars to identify discontinuities in the scales of movement by caribou found in forested and alpine (above tree line) habitats. We differentiated intra- from interpatch movements and identified collections of patches (multiple-patch scale) where caribou concentrated intrapatch movements. On average, intra- and interpatch movements were 450.7 and 1268.8 m, respectively, and multiple-patch movements occurred over an area of 182 ha. Intrapatch movements were highly correlated, indicative of a strong relationship between behavior and place. Caribou in the forest selected patches of Pine terrace, whereas caribou in the alpine selected patches of Alpine-little vegetative cover. Predation risk was not a factor influencing movements of caribou at the intrapatch scale. Selection of cover types was more variable during interpatch movements. At that scale, caribou selected patches of Pine terrace, Lakes/rivers, Alpine-little vegetative cover, and Alpine-grass. The routes selected by caribou had lower energetic costs relative to surrounding terrain, and during some winters, caribou were subjected to higher levels of predation risk during those movements. At the multiple-patch scale, selection was more specific and encompassed patches of Alpine-little vegetative cover, Alpine-grass, and Pine terrace. Predation risk was relatively unimportant at the multi-patch scale, but animals that moved from forested to alpine habitats reduced their relative risk of predation. Patch configuration was a poor predictor of those areas where caribou concentrated intrapatch movements. There was some evidence of caribou selecting patches of Pine terrace within a matrix of Wetlands and Pine-black spruce/black spruce patches. Caribou in the alpine avoided patches of Alpine-little vegetative cover adjacent to forest types. Our results indicate that forest managers should maintain widely distributed patches of Pine terrace and implement silvicultural regimes that do not stimulate predator populations across areas used for interpatch movements.},

abstract = {Context Conservation corridors must facilitate long-distance dispersal movements to promote gene flow, prevent inbreeding, and allow animals to shift ranges with climate change. Least-cost models are used to identify areas that support long-distance movement. These models rely on estimates of landscape resistance, which are typically derived from habitat suitability. Objectives We examine two key steps in estimating resistance from habitat suitability: choosing a procedure to estimate habitat suitability, and choosing a transformation function to translate habitat suitability into resistance. Methods We used linear and nonlinear functions to convert three types of habitat suitability estimates (from expert opinion, resource selection functions, and step selection functions) into resistances for elk (Cervus canadensis) and desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni). We evaluated the resulting resistance maps on an independent set of observed long-distance, prospecting movements. Results A negative exponential function best described the relationship between resistance values and habitat suitability for desert bighorn sheep indi-cating long-distance movers readily travel through moderately-suitable areas and avoid only the least suitable habitat. For desert bighorn sheep, all three suitability estimates performed better than chance, and resource and step selection functions outperformed expert opinion. For elk, all three suitability estimates performed the same as chance. Conclusions When designing corridors to facilitate long-distance movements of mobile animals, we recommend transforming habitat suitability into resis-tance with a negative exponential function. Use of an exponential transformation means that larger fractions of the landscape offer low resistance, allowing greater flexibility in where a corridor is located.},

abstract = {Levels of gene flow among populations vary both inter- and intraspecifically, and understanding the ecological bases of variation in levels of gene flow represents an important link between the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of populations. The effects of habitat spatial structure on gene flow have received considerable attention; however, most studies have been conducted at a single spatial scale and without background data on how individual movement is affected by landscape features. We examined the influence of habitat connectivity on inferred levels of gene flow in a high-altitude, meadow-dwelling butterfly, Parnassius smintheus. For this species, we had background data on the effects of landscape structure on both individual movement and on small-scale population genetic differentiation. We compared genetic differentiation and patterns of isolation by distance, based on variation at seven microsatellite loci, among three regions representing two levels of connectivity of high-altitude, nonforested habitats. We found that reduced connectivity of habitats, resulting from more forest cover at high altitudes, was associated with greater genetic differentiation among populations (higher estimated F-ST), a breakdown of isolation by distance, and overall lower levels of inferred gene flow. These observed differences were consistent with expectations based on our knowledge of the movement behaviour of this species and on previous population genetic analyses conducted at the smaller spatial scale. Our results indicate that the role of gene flow may vary among groups of populations depending on the interplay between individual movement and the structure of the surrounding landscape.},

abstract = {Habitat connectivity and corridors are often assumed to be critical for the persistence of patchily distributed populations, but empirical evidence for this assumption is scarce. We assessed the importance of connectivity among habitat patches for dispersal by a mature-forest obligate, the Boreal Owl (Aegolius funereus). Boreal Owls demonstrated a lack of genetic structure (theta = 0.004 +/- 0.002 [SE]) among subpopulations, regardless of matrix type and extent, which indicates that unforested matrix does not act as a barrier to dispersal for this vagile species. We found only slightly higher genetic distances (Cavalli-Sforza chord distances ranged from 0.015 to 0.025) among patchily distributed Rocky Mountain subpopulations as compared with largely contiguous boreal-forest subpopulations (0.013 to 0.019) and no evidence of a genetic split across the expansive high plains of Wyoming. Even the most isolated subalpine patches are connected via gene flow. As northern boreal forests continue to experience intensive harvest of mature stands, geographic dispersion of Boreal Owl habitat may begin to more closely resemble that found in the Rocky Mountains. We suggest that decreased connectivity poses much less of a threat to continued abundance of this mature-forest obligate than overall loss of nesting and foraging habitat. Assessment of the importance of corridors and connectivity should be conducted on a species-by-species basis, given the variation in response of species to discontinuity of habitat, even among closely related taxa or guilds.},

abstract = {Accurate resource selection functions (RSFs) are important for managing animal populations. Developing RSFs using data from GPS telemetry can be problematic due to serial autocorrelation, but modern analytical techniques can help to compensate for this correlation. We used telemetry locations from 18 woodland caribou Rangifer tarandus caribou in Saskatchewan, Canada, to compare marginal (population-specific) generalized estimating equations (GEEs), and conditional (subject-specific) generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs), for developing resource selection functions at two spatial scales. We evaluated the use of empirical standard errors, which are robust to misspecification of the correlation structure. We compared these approaches with destructive sampling. Statistical significance was strongly influenced by the use of empirical vs. model-based standard errors, and marginal (GEE) and conditional (GLMM) results differed. Destructive sampling reduced apparent habitat selection. k-fold cross-validation results differed for GEE and GLMM, as it must be applied differently for each model. Synthesis and applications. Due to their different interpretations, marginal models (e.g. generalized estimating equations, GEEs) may be better for landscape and population management, while conditional models (e.g. generalized linear mixed-effects models, GLMMs) may be better for management of endangered species and individuals. Destructive sampling may lead to inaccurate resource selection functions (RSFs), but GEEs and GLMMs can be used for developing RSFs when used with empirical standard errors.},

Connectivity is known to positively influence metapopulation demography and genetics by increasing the rescue effect and thus favoring individual and gene flow between populations. This result has not been tested in the special case of dendritic networks, which encompass stream and cave ecosystem for instance. We propose a first approach using an individual based model to explore the population demography and genetics in various dendritic networks. To do so, we first generate a large number of different networks, and we analyze the relationship between their hydrographical characteristics and connectivity. We show that connectivity mean and variance of connectivity are strongly correlated in dendritic networks. Connectivity segregates two types of networks: Hortonian and non-Hortonian networks. We then simulate the population dynamics for a simple life cycle in each of the generated networks, and we analyze persistence time as well as populations structure at quasi-stationary state. Our main results show that connectivity in dendritic networks can promote local extinction and genetic isolation by distance at low dispersal and diminish the size of the metapopulation at high dispersal. We discuss these unexpected findings in the light of connectivity spatial distribution in dendritic networks in the case of our model.},

abstract = {Graph-theoretic connectivity analyses have received much attention in connectivity evaluation during the last few years. Here, we explore the underlying conceptual differences of various graph-theoretic connectivity measures. Based on connectivity analyses from three reserve networks in forested landscapes in Central Finland, we illustrate how these conceptual differences cause inconsistent connectivity evaluations at both the landscape and patch level. Our results also illustrate how the characteristics of the networks (patch density) may affect the performance of the different measures. Many of the connectivity measures react to changes in habitat connectivity in an ecologically undesirable manner. Patch prioritisations based on a node removal analysis were sensitive to the connectivity measure they were based on. The patch prioritisations derived from different measures showed a disparity in terms of how much weight they put on patch size versus patch location and how they value patch location. Although graphs operate at the interface of structure and function, there is still much to do for incorporating the inferred ecological process into graph structures and analyses. If graph analyses are going to be used for real-world management and conservation purposes, a more thorough understanding of the caveats and justifications of the graph-theoretic connectivity measures will be needed.},

abstract = {We present a new multivariate technique for testing the significance of individual terms in a multifactorial analysis-of-variance model for multispecies response variables. The technique will allow researchers to base analyses on measures of association (distance measures) that are ecologically relevant. In addition, unlike other distance-based hypothesis-testing techniques, this method allows tests of significance of interaction terms in a linear model. The technique uses the existing method of redundancy analysis (RDA) but allows the analysis to be based on Bray-Curtis or other ecologically meaningful measures through the use of principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). Steps in the procedure include: (1) calculating a matrix of distances among replicates using a distance measure of choice (e.g,, Bray-Curtis); (2) determining the principal coordinates (including a correction for negative eigenvalues if necessary), which preserve these distances (3) creating a matrix of dummy variables corresponding to the design of the experiment (i.e., individual terms in a linear model); (4) analyzing thr relationship between thp principal coordinates (species data) and the dummy variables (model) using RDA; and (5) implementing a test by permutation for particular statistics corresponding to the particular terms in the model. This method has certain advantages not shared by other multivariate testing procedures. We demonstrate the use of this technique with experimental ecological data from intertidal assemblages and show how the presence of significant multivariate interactions can be interpreted. It is our view that distance-based RDA will be extremely useful to ecologists measuring multispecies responses to structured multifactorial experimental designs.},

abstract = {The Mantel test is widely used to test the linear or monotonic independence of the elements in two distance matrices. It is one of the few appropriate tests when the hypothesis under study can only be formulated in terms of distances; this is often the case with genetic data. In particular, the Mantel test has been widely used to test for spatial relationship between genetic data and spatial layout of the sampling locations. We describe the domain of application of the Mantel test and derived forms. Formula development demonstrates that the sum-of-squares (SS) partitioned in Mantel tests and regression on distance matrices differs from the SS partitioned in linear correlation, regression and canonical analysis. Numerical simulations show that in tests of significance of the relationship between simple variables and multivariate data tables, the power of linear correlation, regression and canonical analysis is far greater than that of the Mantel test and derived forms, meaning that the former methods are much more likely than the latter to detect a relationship when one is present in the data. Examples of difference in power are given for the detection of spatial gradients. Furthermore, the Mantel test does not correctly estimate the proportion of the original data variation explained by spatial structures. The Mantel test should not be used as a general method for the investigation of linear relationships or spatial structures in univariate or multivariate data. Its use should be restricted to tests of hypotheses that can only be formulated in terms of distances.},

abstract = {This paper has two complementary purposes: first, to present a method to perform multiple regression on distance matrices, with permutation testing appropriate for path-length matrices representing evolutionary trees, and then, to apply this method to study the joint evolution of brain, behavior and other characteristics in marsupials. To understand the computation method, consider that the dependent matrix is unfolded as a vector y; similarly, consider X to be a table containing the independent matrices, also unfolded as vectors. A multiple regression is computed to express y as a function of X. The parameters of this regression (R(2) and partial regression coefficients) are tested by permutations, as follows. When the dependent matrix variable y represents a simple distance or similarity matrix, permutations are performed in the same manner as the Mantel permutational test. When it is an ultrametric matrix representing a dendrogram, we use the double-permutation method (Lapointe and legendre 1990, 1991). When it is a path-length matrix representing an additive tree (cladogram), we use the triple-permutation method (Lapointe and Legendre 1992). The independent matrix variables in X are kept fixed with respect to one another during the permutations. Selection of predictors can be accomplished by forward selection, backward elimination, or a stepwise procedure. A phylogenetic tree, derived from marsupial brain morphology data (28 species), is compared to trees depicting the evolution of diet, sociability, locomotion, and habitat in these animals, as well as their taxonomy and geographical relationships. A model is derived in which brain evolution can be predicted from taxonomy, diet, sociability and locomotion (R(2) = 0.75). A new tree, derived from the ''predicted'' data, shows a lot of similarity to the brain evolution tree. The meaning of the taxonomy, diet, sociability, and locomotion predictors are discussed and conclusions are drawn about the evolution of brain and behavior in marsupials.},

The software is developed for high-performance computing, but scales to consumer-grade desktop computers running modern Linux or Mac OS X operating systems. 3. We report high computational efficiency representing a 173× speedup over existing software using high-performance computing and a 8{\textperiodcentered}4× speedup using a desktop computer while drastically reducing memory requirements. 4. gflow allows large-extent and high-resolution connectivity problems to be calculated over many iterations and at multiple scales.

abstract = {Analyses of fine-scale and macrogeographic genetic structure in plant populations provide an initial indication of how gene flow, natural selection, and genetic drift may collectively influence the distribution of genetic variation. The objective of our study is to evaluate the spatial dispersion of alleles within and among subpopulations of a tropical shrub, Psychotria officinalis (Rubiaceae), in a lowland wet forest in Costa Rica. This insect-pollinated, self-incompatible understory plant is dispersed primarily by birds, some species of which drop the seeds immediately while others transport seeds away from the parent plant. Thus, pollination should promote gene flow while at least one type of seed dispersal agent might restrict gene flow. Sampling from five subpopulations in undisturbed wet forest at Estacion Biologica La Selva, Costa Rica, we used electrophoretically detected isozyme markers to examine the spatial scale of genetic structure. Our goals are: 1) describe genetic diversity of each of the five subpopulations of Psychotria officinalis sampled within a contiguous wet tropical forest; 2) evaluate fine-scale genetic structure of adults of P. officinalis within a single 2.25-ha mapped plot; and 3) estimate genetic structure of P. officinalis using data from five subpopulations located up to 2 km apart. Using estimates of coancestry, statistical analyses reveal significant positive genetic correlations between individuals on a scale of 5 m but no significant genetic relatedness beyond that interplant distance within the studied subpopulation. Multilocus estimates of genetic differentiation among subpopulations were low, but significant (F-st = 0.095). Significant F-st estimates were largely attributable to a single locus (Lap-2). Thus, multilocus estimates of F-st may be influenced by microgeographic selection. If true, then the observed levels of IBD may be overestimates.},

In a comparison with other published estimators of pairwise relatedness, we find these new "regression" estimators to be computationally simpler and to yield similar or lower sampling variances, particularly when many loci are used or when loci are hypervariable. Two examples are given in which the new estimators are applied to natural populations, one that reveals isolation-by-distance in an annual plant and the other that suggests a genetic basis for a coat color polymorphism in bears.},

This understanding is crucial, not only for improving ecological knowledge, but also for managing properly the genetic diversity of threatened and endangered populations. For nearly 80 years, population geneticists have investigated how physiognomy and other landscape features have influenced genetic variation within and between populations. They have relied on sampling populations that have been identified beforehand because most population genetics methods have required discrete populations. However, a new approach has emerged for analyzing spatial genetic data without requiring that discrete populations be identified in advance. This approach, landscape genetics, promises to facilitate our understanding of how geographical and environmental features structure genetic variation at both the population and individual levels, and has implications for ecology, evolution and conservation biology. It differs from other genetic approaches, such as phylogeography, in that it tends to focus on processes at finer spatial and temporal scales. Here, we discuss, from a population genetic perspective, the current tools available for conducting studies of landscape genetics.},

abstract = {Paternity inference using highly polymorphic codominant markers is becoming common in the study of natural populations. However, multiple males are often found to be genetically compatible with each offspring tested, even when the probability of excluding an unrelated male is high. While various methods exist for evaluating the likelihood of paternity of each nonexcluded male, interpreting these likelihoods has hitherto been difficult, and no method takes account of the incomplete sampling and error-prone genetic data typical of large-scale studies of natural systems. We derive likelihood ratios for paternity inference with codominant markers taking account of typing error, and define a statistic Delta for resolving paternity. Using allele frequencies from the study population in question, a simulation program generates criteria for Delta that permit assignment of paternity to the most likely male with a known level of statistical confidence. The simulation takes account of the number of candidate males, the proportion of males that are sampled and gaps and errors in genetic data. We explore the potentially confounding effect of relatives and show that the method is robust to their presence under commonly encountered conditions. The method is demonstrated using genetic data from the intensively studied led deer (Cervus elaphus) population on the island of Rum, Scotland. The Windows-based computer program, CERVUS dagger, described in this study is available from the authors. CERVUS can be used to calculate allele frequencies, run simulations and perform parentage analysis using data from all types of codominant markers.},

Previous nonparametric methods have succeeded in one or other of these areas, but not in both. A recent contribution to Ecological Monographs by Legendre and Anderson, called distance-based redundancy analysis (db-RDA), does achieve both. It does this by calculating principal coordinates and subsequently correcting for negative eigenvalues, if they are present, by adding a constant to squared distances. We show here that such a correction is not necessary. Partitioning can be achieved directly from the distance matrix itself, with no corrections and no eigenanalysis, even if the distance measure used is semimetric. An ecological example is given to show the differences in these statistical methods. Empirical simulations, based on parameters estimated from real ecological species abundance data, showed that db-RDA done on multifactorial designs (using the correction) does not have type I error consistent with the significance level chosen for the analysis (i.e., does not provide an exact test), whereas the direct method described and advocated here does.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic habitat fragmentation - ubiquitous in modern ecosystems - has strong impacts on gene flow and genetic population structure. Reptiles may be particularly susceptible to the effects of fragmentation because of their extreme sensitivity to environmental conditions and limited dispersal. We investigate fine-scale spatial genetic structure, individual relatedness, and sex-biased dispersal in a large population of a long-lived reptile (tuatara, Sphenodon punctatus) on a recently fragmented island. We genotyped individuals from remnant forest, regenerating forest, and grassland pasture sites at seven microsatellite loci and found significant genetic structuring (R-ST = 0.012) across small distances ({\textless} 500 m). Isolation by distance was not evident, but rather, genetic distance was weakly correlated with habitat similarity. Only individuals in forest fragments were correctly assignable to their site of origin, and individual pairwise relatedness in one fragment was significantly higher than expected. We did not detect sex-biased dispersal, but natural dispersal patterns may be confounded by fragmentation. Assignment tests showed that reforestation appears to have provided refuges for tuatara from disturbed areas. Our results suggest that fine-scale genetic structuring is driven by recent habitat modification and compounded by the sedentary lifestyle of these long-lived reptiles. Extreme longevity, large population size, simple social structure and random dispersal are not strong enough to counteract the genetic structure caused by a sedentary lifestyle. We suspect that fine-scale spatial genetic structuring could occur in any sedentary species with limited dispersal, making them more susceptible to the effects of fragmentation.},

abstract = {I present data from 21 population inventory studies - 20 of them on bears - that relied on the noninvasive collection of hair, and review the methods that were used to prevent genetic errors in these studies. These methods were designed to simultaneously minimize errors (which can bias estimates of abundance) and per-sample analysis effort (which can reduce the precision of estimates by limiting sample size). A variety of approaches were used to probe the reliability of the empirical data, producing a mean, per-study estimate of no more than one undetected error in either direction (too few or too many individuals identified in the laboratory). For the type of samples considered here (plucked hair samples), the gain or loss of individuals in the laboratory can be reduced to a level that is inconsequential relative to the more universal sources of bias and imprecision that can affect mark-recapture studies, assuming that marker systems are selected according to stated guidelines, marginal samples are excluded at an early stage, similar pairs of genotypes are scrutinized, and laboratory work is performed with skill and care.},

We used simulated data sets to test the power and accuracy of Monte Carlo resampling methods in generating statistical thresholds for identifying F-0 immigrants in populations with ongoing gene flow, and hence for providing direct, real-time estimates of migration rates. The identification of accurate critical values required that resampling methods preserved the linkage disequilibrium deriving from recent generations of immigrants and reflected the sampling variance present in the data set being analysed. A novel Monte Carlo resampling method taking into account these aspects was proposed and its efficiency was evaluated. Power and error were relatively insensitive to the frequency assumed for missing alleles. Power to identify F-0 immigrants was improved by using large sample size (up to about 50 individuals) and by sampling all populations from which migrants may have originated. A combination of plotting genotype likelihoods and calculating mean genotype likelihood ratios (D-LR) appeared to be an effective way to predict whether F-0 immigrants could be identified for a particular pair of populations using a given set of markers.},

abstract = {The loss of connectivity of natural areas is a major threat for wildlife dispersal and survival and for the conservation of biodiversity in general. Thus, there is an increasing interest in considering connectivity in landscape planning and habitat conservation. In this context, graph structures have been shown to be a powerful and effective way of both representing the landscape pattern as a network and performing complex analysis regarding landscape connectivity. Many indices have been used for connectivity analyses so far but comparatively very little efforts have been made to understand their behaviour and sensitivity to spatial changes, which seriously undermines their adequate interpretation and usefulness. We systematically compare a set of ten graph-based connectivity indices, evaluating their reaction to different types of change that can occur in the landscape (habitat patches loss, corridors loss, etc.) and their effectiveness for identifying which landscape elements are more critical for habitat conservation. Many of the available indices were found to present serious limitations that make them inadequate as a basis for conservation planning. We present a new index (IIC) that achieves all the properties of an ideal index according to our analysis. We suggest that the connectivity problem should be considered within the wider concept of habitat availability, which considers a habitat patch itself as a space where connectivity exists, integrating habitat amount and connectivity between habitat patches in a single measure.},

abstract = {Landscape genetics is an important framework for investigating the influence of spatial pattern on ecological process. Nevertheless, the standard analytic frameworks in landscape genetics have difficulty evaluating hypotheses about spatial processes in dynamic landscapes. We use a predictive hypothesis-driven approach to quantify the relative contribution of historic and contemporary processes to genetic connectivity. By confronting genetic data with models of historic and contemporary landscapes, we identify dispersal processes operating in naturally heterogeneous and human-altered systems. We demonstrate the approach using a case study of microsatellite polymorphism and indirect estimates of gene flow for a rainforest bird, the logrunner (Orthonyx temminckii). Of particular interest was how much information in the genetic data was attributable to processes occurring in the reconstructed historic landscape and contemporary human-modified landscape. A linear mixed model was used to estimate appropriate sampling variance from nonindependent data and information-theoretic model selection provided strength of evidence for alternative hypotheses. The contemporary landscape explained slightly more information in the genetic differentiation data than the historic landscape, and there was considerable evidence for a temporal shift in dispersal pattern. In contrast, migration rates estimated from genealogical information were primarily influenced by contemporary landscape change. We discovered that landscape heterogeneity facilitated gene flow before European settlement, but contemporary deforestation is rapidly becoming the most important barrier to logrunner dispersal.},

We assume a model in which there are K populations (where K may be unknown), each of which is characterized by a set of allele frequencies at each locus. Individuals in the sample are assigned (probabilistically) to populations, or jointly to two or more populations if their genotypes indicate that they are admixed. Our model does not assume a particular mutation process, and it can be applied to most of the commonly used genetic markers, provided that they are not closely linked. Applications of our method include demonstrating the presence of population structure, assigning individuals to populations, studying hybrid zones, and identifying migrants and admired individuals. We show that the method can produce highly accurate assignments using modest numbers of loci-e.g., seven microsatellite loci in an example using genotype data from an endangered bird species.

The parentage assessments took advantage of maximum likelihood procedures developed expressly for situations when individuals of neither gender can be excluded a priori as candidate parents. The molecular data for 290 individuals, interpreted alone and in conjunction with detailed biological and spatial information for the population, demonstrate high exclusion probabilities and reasonably strong likelihoods of genetic parentage assignment in many cases; low mean probabilities of successful reproductive contribution to the local population by individual armadillo adults in a given year; and statistically significant microspatial associations of parents and their offspring. Results suggest that molecular assays of highly polymorphic genetic systems can add considerable power to assessments of biological parentage in natural populations even when neither parent is otherwise known.},

This fusion of interests has led to a burst of research on the properties and consequences of network structure in biological systems. Although traditional measures of network structure and function have started us off on the right foot, an important next step is to create biologically realistic models of network formation, evolution, and function. Here, we review recent applications of network thinking to the evolution of networks at the gene and protein level and to the dynamics and stability of communities. These studies have provided new insights into the organization and function of biological systems by applying existing techniques of network analysis. The current challenge is to recognize the commonalities in evolutionary and ecological applications of network thinking to create a predictive science of biological networks.},

abstract = {Graph theory, network theory, and circuit theory are increasingly being used to quantify multiple aspects of habitat connectivity and protected areas. There has been an explosive proliferation of network (connectivity) measures, resulting in over 60 measures for ecologists to now choose from. Conceptual clarification on the ecological meaning of these network measures and their interrelationships is overdue. We present a framework that categorizes network measures based on the connectivity property that they quantify (i.e., route-specific flux, route redundancy, route vulnerability, and connected habitat area) and the structural level of the habitat network to which they apply. The framework reveals a lack of network measures in the categories of "route-specific flux among neighboring habitat patches'' and "route redundancy at the level of network components.'' We propose that network motif and path redundancy measures can be developed to fill the gaps in these categories. The value of this framework lies in its ability to inform the selection and application of network measures. Ultimately, it will allow a better comparison among graph, network, and circuit analyses, which will improve the design and management of connected landscapes.},

abstract = {Maintaining and restoring connectivity among high-quality habitat patches is recognized as an important goal for the conservation of animal populations. To provide an efficient measure of potential connectivity pathways in heterogeneous landscapes, least-cost route analysis has been combined with graph-theoretical techniques. In this study we use spatially explicit least-cost habitat graphs to examine how matrix quality and spatial configuration influence assessments of habitat connectivity. We generated artificial landscapes comprised of three landcover types ranked consistently from low to high quality: inhospitable matrix, hospitable matrix, and habitat. We controlled the area and degree of fragmentation of each landcover in a factorial experiment for a total of 20 combinations replicated 100 times. In each landscape we compared eight sets of relative landcover qualities (cost values of 1 for habitat, between 1.5 and 150 for hospitable matrix, and 3-10,000 for inhospitable matrix). We found that the spatial location of least-cost routes was sensitive to differences in relative cost values assigned to landcover types and that the degree of sensitivity depended on the spatial structure of the landscape. Highest sensitivity was found in landscapes with fragmented habitat and between 20 and 50{\%} hospitable matrix; sensitivity decreased as habitat fragmentation decreased and the amount of hospitable matrix increased. As a means of coping with this sensitivity, we propose identifying multiple low-cost routes between pairs of habitat patches that collectively delineate probable movement zones. These probable movement zones account for uncertainty in least-cost routes and may be more robust to variation in landcover cost values.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Landscape barriers influence movement patterns of animals, which in turn, affect spatio-temporal spread of infectious wildlife disease. We compare genetic data from computer simulations to those acquired from field samples to measure the effect of a landscape barrier on raccoon (Procyon lotor) movement, enabling risk assessment of raccoon rabies disease spread across the Niagara River from New York State into Ontario, an area currently uninfected by rabies. An individual-based spatially explicit model is used to simulate the expansion of a raccoon population to cross the Niagara River, for different permeabilities of the river to raccoon crossings. Since the model records individual raccoon genetics, the genetic population structure of neutral mitochondrial DNA haplotypes are characterised in the expanding population, every 25 years, using a genetic distance measure, phi sT, Mantel tests and a gene diversity measure. The river barrier effect is assessed by comparing genetic measures computed from model outputs to those calculated from 166 raccoons recently sampled from the same landscape. The "best fit" between modelled scenarios and field data indicate the river prevents 50{\%} of attempts to cross the river. Founder effects dominated the colonizing genetic Population structure, and, as the river barrier effect increased, its genetic diversity decreased. Using gene flow to calibrate the effect of the river as a barrier to movement provides an estimate of the effect of a river in reducing the likelihood of cross-river infection. Including individual genetic markers in simulation modelling benefits investigations of disease spread and control. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Roads present formidable barriers to dispersal. We examine movements of two highly mobile carnivores across the Ventura Freeway near Los Angeles, one of the busiest highways in the United States. The two species, bobcats and coyotes, can disappear from habitats isolated and fragmented by roads, and their ability to disperse across the Ventura Freeway tests the limits of vertebrates to overcome anthropogenic obstacles. We combine radio-telemetry data and genetically based assignments to identify individuals that have crossed the freeway. Although the freeway is a significant barrier to dispersal, we find that carnivores can cross the freeway and that 5-32{\%} of sampled carnivores crossed over a 7-year period. However, despite moderate levels of migration, populations on either side of the freeway are genetically differentiated, and coalescent modelling shows their genetic isolation is consistent with a migration fraction less than 0.5{\%} per generation. These results imply that individuals that cross the freeway rarely reproduce. Highways and development impose artificial home range boundaries on territorial and reproductive individuals and hence decrease genetically effective migration. Further, territory pile-up at freeway boundaries may decrease reproductive opportunities for dispersing individuals that do manage to cross. Consequently, freeways are filters favouring dispersing individuals that add to the migration rate but little to gene flow. Our results demonstrate that freeways can restrict gene flow even in wide-ranging species and suggest that for territorial animals, migration levels across anthropogenic barriers need to be an order of magnitude larger than commonly assumed to counteract genetic differentiation.},

abstract = {Landscape structure can influence the fine-scale movement behavior of dispersing animals, which ultimately may influence ecological patterns and processes at broader scales. Functional grain refers to the finest scale at which an organism responds to spatial heterogeneity among patches and extends to the limits of its perceptual range. To determine the functional grain of a model insect, red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum), we examined its movement behavior in response to experimental flour landscapes. Landscape structure was varied by manipulating habitat abundance (0{\%}, 10{\%}, 30{\%}, and 100{\%}) and grain size of patches (fine-2 x 2 cm, intermediate-5 x 5 cm, and coarse-10 x 10 cm) in 50 x 50 cm landscapes. Pathway metrics indicated that beetles used a similar proportion of all landscape types. Several pathway metrics indicated a graded response from the fine to the coarse grain landscape. Lacunarity analysis of beetle pathways indicated a non-linear change in space use between the fine and intermediate landscapes and the coarse-grained landscape. Beetles moved more slowly and tortuously (with many turns), and remained longer in both the overall landscape and individual patches, in fine-grained compared to coarse-grained landscapes. Our research demonstrates how detailed examination of movement pathways and measures of lacunarity can be useful in determining functional grain. Spatially explicit, organism-centered studies focusing on behavioral responses to different habitat configurations can serve as an important first step to identify behavioral rules of movement that may ultimately lead to more accurate predictions of space use in landscapes.},

This method is based on results of models of isolation by distance common to a wide variety of dispersal distances. The performance of this method is tested by simulation for some highly leptokurtic dispersal distributions, and it is applied to a previous study of a kangaroo-rat (Dipodomys spectabilis) population. In this case, genetic and demographic estimates are within a factor of two from each other. Thus, in line with some previous examples, this study shows that a better agreement may be attained than is usually recognized between genetic and demographic estimates.},

abstract = {Environmental change has a wide range of ecological consequences, including species extinction and range expansion. Many studies have shown that insect species respond rapidly to climatic change. A mountain pine beetle epidemic of record size in North America has led to unprecedented mortality of lodgepole pine, and a significant range expansion to the northeast of its historic range. Our goal was to determine the spatial genetic variation found among outbreak population from which genetic structure, and dispersal patterns may be inferred. Beetles from 49 sampling locations throughout the outbreak area in western Canada were analysed at 13 microsatellite loci. We found significant north-south population structure as evidenced by: (i) Bayesian-based analyses, (ii) north-south genetic relationships and diversity gradients; and (iii) a lack of isolation-by-distance in the northernmost cluster. The north-south structure is proposed to have arisen from the processes of postglacial colonization as well as recent climate-driven changes in population dynamics. Our data support the hypothesis of multiple sources of origin for the outbreak and point to the need for population specific information to improve our understanding and management of outbreaks. The recent range expansion across the Rocky Mountains into the jack/lodgepole hybrid and pure jack pine zones of northern Alberta is consistent with a northern British Columbia origin. We detected no loss of genetic variability in these populations, indicating that the evolutionary potential of mountain pine beetle to adapt has not been reduced by founder events. This study illustrates a rapid range-wide response to the removal of climatic constraints, and the potential for range expansion of a regional population.},

abstract = {Graph structures and habitat availability metrics are two recent and complementary approaches for analysing landscape connectivity. They have gained rapid popularity and provided significant conceptual improvements for decision making in conservation planning. We present a further methodological development of the habitat availability concept and metrics by partitioning them into three separate fractions that quantify the different ways in which individual landscape elements can contribute to overall habitat connectivity and availability in the landscape, including stepping stone effects. These fractions are derived from the same concept, are measured in the same units and can be directly compared and combined within a unifying framework. This avoids the problematic and, so far, usual combination of metrics coming from different backgrounds and the arbitrary weighting of connectivity considerations in a broader context of conservation alternatives. We analyse how the relative importance of each fraction varies with species traits. In addition, we show how the critical patches differ for each of the fractions by analysing various forest habitats in the province of Lleida (NE Spain). We discuss the conceptual and conservation implications of this approach, which can be adapted to different degrees of ecological and spatial detail within the graph while still maintaining a coherent framework for the identification of critical elements in the landscape network.},

I analyzed long-term changes in occupancy by taiga-dwelling caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) to estimate their rate of disappearance and time to extirpation in Ontario, Canada. Patterns of range recession, 1880-1990, indicated that half of historic woodland caribou range has been lost, a rate of disappearance of 34,800 km 2 per decade, and a northward range recession of 34 km per decade. The mean metapopulation density, the abundance of discrete winter groups, was one group per 1,900 km 2, suggesting an average loss of 18 caribou wintering areas per decade during this period. There was a strong coincidence between the recent southern limits of caribou occupancy and the northern front of forest harvesting, implying an anthropogenic agent of decline. The estimated time to extirpation of forest-dwelling caribou in Ontario, inferred from the sustained rate of disappearance, was 91 years (95{\%} confidence interval: 57-149 years). The persistence of woodland caribou may depend on spatial separation from human incursion.},

abstract = {The addition of large water storage dams to rivers in California's Central Valley blocked access to spawning habitat and has resulted in a dramatic decline in the distribution and abundance of spring-run chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha (Walbaum 1792). Successful recovery efforts depend on an understanding of the historical spatial structure of these populations, which heretofore has been lacking. Graph theory was used to examine the spatial structure and demographic connectivity of riverine populations of spring-run chinook salmon. Standard graph theoretic measures, including degree, edge weight and node strength, were used to uncover the role of individual populations in this network, i.e. which populations were sources and which were pseudo-sinks. Larger spatially proximate populations, most notably the Pit River, served as sources in the historic graph. These source populations in the graph were marked by an increased number of stronger outbound connections (edges), and on average had few inbound connections. Of the edges in the current graph, seven of them were outbound from a population supported by a hatchery in the Feather River, which suggests a strong influence of the hatchery on the structure of the current extant populations. We tested how the addition of water storage dams fragmented the graph over time by examining changing patterns in connectivity and demographic isolation of individual populations. Dams constructed in larger spatially proximate populations had a strong impact on the independence of remaining populations. Specifically, the addition of dams resulted in lost connections, weaker remaining connections and an increase in demographic isolation. A simulation exercise that removed populations from the graph under different removal scenarios - random removal, removal by decreasing habitat size and removal by decreasing node strength - revealed a potential approach for restoration of these depleted populations. Synthesis and applications. Spatial graphs are drawing the attention of ecologists and managers. Here we have used a directed graph to uncover the historical spatial structure of a threatened species, estimate the connectivity of the current populations, examine how the historical network of populations was fragmented over time and provide a plausible mechanism for ecologically successful restoration. The methods employed here can be applied broadly across taxa and systems, and afford scientists and managers a better understanding of the structure and function of impaired ecosystems.},

abstract = {The ecological consequences of habitat fragmentation include the direct effects of habitat loss and the indirect effects of reduced inter-patch dispersal. In particular, habitat patches that survive the process of fragmentation become increasingly isolated from one another, and this can cause species' declines in excess of predictions based strictly on reductions in habitat area. To quantify the hindrance of-dispersal caused by habitat fragmentation, landscape ecologists have invented the notion of habitat connectivity. Indices of landscape pattern are frequently used to estimate habitat connectivity, but whether they actually do so remains undocumented. If indices of habitat pattern do indeed estimate habitat connectivity, then these indices should correlate well with predictions of dispersal success. To test this possibility, I looked for correlations between nine common indices of habitat pattern and the results of a simulated dispersal process conducted using GIS data on the distribution of old-growth forest through the Pacific Northwest. The nine indices of habitat pattern that I examined were only weakly correlated with the results from the dispersal modeling, but I identified a new pattern index, termed patch cohesion, for which the fit was much better. Moreover, I found patch cohesion to be insensitive to the details and artifacts of the dispersal model. The methodology described here will be useful to investigators using indices of-landscape pattern to quantify habitat fragmentation.},

Effective population sizes in Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming, where most of the wolverines in the contiguous United States exist, were calculated to be 35 (credible limits, 28 52) suggesting low abundance. Landscape features that influence wolverine population substructure and gene flow are largely unknown. Recent work has identified strong associations between areas with persistent spring snow and wolverine presence and range. We tested whether a dispersal model in which wolverines prefer to disperse through areas characterized by persistent spring snow cover produced least-cost paths among all individuals that correlated with genetic distance among individuals. Models simulating large preferences for dispersing within areas characterized by persistent spring snow explained the data better than a model based on Euclidean distance. Partial Mantel tests separating Euclidean distance from spring snow-cover-based effects indicated that Euclidean distance was not significant in describing patterns of genetic distance. Because these models indicated that successful dispersal paths followed areas characterized by spring snow cover, we used these understandings to derive empirically based least-cost corridor maps in the U. S. Rocky Mountains. These corridor maps largely explain previously published population subdivision patterns based on mitochondrial DNA and indicate that natural colonization of the southern Rocky Mountains by wolverines will be difficult but not impossible.},

We developed graph-based connectivity methods to assess the spatial pattern of high susceptibility hosts across broad regions, under historic, existing or future climates.

abstract = {Population genetic theory predicts that plant populations will exhibit internal spatial autocorrelation when propagule flow is restricted, but as an empirical reality, spatial structure is rarely consistent across loci or sites, and is generally weak. A lack of sensitivity in the statistical procedures may explain the discrepancy. Most work to date, based on allozymes, has involved pattern analysis for individual alleles, but new PCR-based genetic markers are coming into vogue, with vastly increased numbers of alleles. The field is badly in need of an explicitly multivariate approach to autocorrelation analysis, and our purpose here is to introduce a new approach that is applicable to multiallelic codominant, multilocus arrays. The procedure treats the genetic data set as a whole, strengthening the spatial signal and reducing the stochastic (allele-to-allele, and locus-to-locus) noise. We (i) develop a very general multivariate method, based on genetic distance methods, (ii) illustrate it for multiallelic codominant loci, and (iii) provide nonparametric permutational testing procedures for the full correlogram. We illustrate the new method with an example data set from the orchid Caladenia tentaculata, for which we show (iv) how the multivariate treatment compares with the single-allele treatment, (v) that intermediate frequency alleles from highly polymorphic loci perform well and rare alleles poorly, (vi) that a multilocus treatment provides clearer answers than separate single-locus treatments, and (vii) that weighting alleles differentially improves our resolution minimally. The results, though specific to Caladenia, offer encouragement for wider application.},

abstract = {Estimates of population size and density are essential for successful management and conservation of any species. Although there are a variety of methods available for estimating abundance and density of populations, most studies rely on only one estimator and very few studies have compared and critically evaluated the adequacy and the cost of these methods. We used the brown bear (Ursus arctos) in south-central Sweden to compare the performance of three different methods of estimating population size, including methods based on conventional field data as well as on non-invasive genetic data. The method based on observations of females with cubs underestimated the true population size, as the estimates were below the number of unique genotypes determined from faecal data inside the study area. The best traditional method was based on observations of bears from a helicopter. The genetic method using the closed population MARK estimator, as recommended in a previous study, seemed to perform the best. We conclude that approximately 223 (188-282) bears were present in our 7328 km(2) Study area during 2001 and 2002 and suggest that this hunted brown bear population has been relatively stable for about ten years. The non-invasive genetic method was less expensive than the most reliable traditional field method (a CMR method based on observations of bears from a helicopter), and preferable from an ethical point of view. We recommend that future studies using non-invasive genetic methods based on collected faecal samples should aim at collecting 2.5-3 times the number of faecal samples as the "assumed" number of animals.

abstract = {The natterjack toad (Bufo calamita) is endangered in several parts of its distribution, including Belgium, where it occurs mainly in artificial habitats. We parameterized a general model for natterjack population viability analysis (PVA) and tested its sensitivity to changes in the values of basic parameters. Then we assessed the relative efficiency of various conservation measures in 2 situations: a small isolated population and a system of 4 populations connected by rare dispersal movements. We based the population viability analysis on a stage-structured model of natterjack population dynamics. We parameterized the model in the RAMAS GIS platform with vital rates obtained from our own field experience and from published studies. Simulated natterjack populations were highly sensitive to habitat quality (particularly pond drying), to dispersal from surrounding local populations, and to a lesser extent to values of fecundity and survival of terrestrial stages. Population trajectories were nearly insensitive to initial abundances, carrying capacities, and the frequency of extreme climatic conditions. The simulations showed that in habitats with highly ephemeral ponds, where premetamorphosis mortality was high, natterjack populations nearly always had a very high extinction risk. We also illustrated how low dispersal rates ({\textless}1 dispersing individual/generation) efficiently rescued declining local populations. Such source-sink dynamics demonstrate that the identification and management of source populations should be a high priority.},

abstract = {Functional connectivity is a key factor for the persistence of many specialist species in fragmented landscapes. However, connectivity estimates have rarely been validated by the observation of dispersal movements. In this study, we estimated functional connectivity of a real landscape by modelling dispersal for the endangered natterjack toad (Bufo calamita) using cost distance. Cost distance allows the evaluation of 'effective distances', which are distances corrected for the costs involved in moving between habitat patches in spatially explicit landscapes. We parameterized cost-distance models using the results of our previous experimental investigation of natterjack's movement behaviour. These model predictions (connectivity estimates from the GIS study) were then confronted to genetic-based dispersal rates between natterjack populations in the same landscape using Mantel tests. Dispersal rates between the populations were inferred from variation at six microsatellite loci. Based on these results, we conclude that matrix structure has a strong effect on dispersal rates. Moreover, we found that cost distances generated by habitat preferences explained dispersal rates better than did the Euclidian distances, or the connectivity estimate based on patch-specific resistances (patch viscosity). This study is a clear example of how landscape genetics can validate operational functional connectivity estimates.},

abstract = {Landscape genetics has emerged as a new research area that integrates population genetics, landscape ecology and spatial statistics. Researchers in this field can combine the high resolution of genetic markers with spatial data and a variety of statistical methods to evaluate the role that landscape variables play in shaping genetic diversity and population structure. While interest in this research area is growing rapidly, our ability to fully utilize landscape data, test explicit hypotheses and truly integrate these diverse disciplines has lagged behind. Part of the current challenge in the development of the field of landscape genetics is bridging the communication and knowledge gap between these highly specific and technical disciplines. The goal of this review is to help bridge this gap by exposing geneticists to terminology, sampling methods and analysis techniques widely used in landscape ecology and spatial statistics but rarely addressed in the genetics literature. We offer a definition for the term 'landscape genetics', provide an overview of the landscape genetics literature, give guidelines for appropriate sampling design and useful analysis techniques, and discuss future directions in the field. We hope, this review will stimulate increased dialog and enhance interdisciplinary collaborations advancing this exciting new field.},

abstract = {Natal dispersal is a process that is critical in the spatial dynamics of populations, including population spread, recolonization, and gene flow. It is a central focus of conservation issues for many vertebrate species. Using data for 77 bird and 68 mammal species, we tested whether median and maximum natal dispersal distances were correlated with body mass, diet type, social system, taxonomic family, and migratory status. Body mass and diet type were found to predict both median and maximum natal dispersal distances in mammals: large species dispersed farther than small ones, and carnivorous species dispersed farther than herbivores and omnivores. Similar relationships occurred for carnivorous bird species, but not for herbivorous or omnivorous ones. Natal dispersal distances in birds or mammals were not significantly related to broad categories of social systems. Only in birds were factors such as taxonomic relatedness and migratory status correlated with natal dispersal, and then only for maximum distances. Summary properties of dispersal processes appeared to be derived from interactions among behavioral and morphological characteristics of species and from their linkages to the dynamics of resource availability in landscapes. In all the species we examined, most dispersers moved relatively short distances, and long-distance dispersal was uncommon. On the basis of these findings, we fit an empirical model based on the negative exponential distribution for calculating minimum probabilities that animals disperse particular distances from their natal areas. This model, coupled with knowledge of a species' body mass and diet type, can be used to conservatively predict dispersal distances for different species and examine possible consequences of large-scale habitat alterations on connectedness between populations. Taken together, our results can provide managers with the means to identify species vulnerable to landscape-level habitat changes such as forest fragmentation. In addition, our dispersal models can be used to predict which species in a community are likely to be the most vulnerable to loss of connectedness and allow managers to test the merits of alternative habitat conservation plans.},

Under these circumstances, it is possible (i) that one allele of a heterozygous individual will not be detected and (ii) that PCR-generated alleles or 'false alleles' will arise. A mathematical model has been developed to account for stochastic events when pipetting template DNA in a very dilute DNA extract and computer simulations have been performed. Laboratory experiments were also carried out using DNA extracted from a bear feces sample to determine if experimental results correlate with the mathematical model. The results of 150 typing experiments are consistent with the proposed model. Based on this model and the level of observed false alleles, an experimental procedure using the multiple tubes approach is proposed to obtain reliable genotypes with a confidence level of 99{\%}. This multiple tubes procedure should be systematically used when genotyping nuclear loci of ancient or forensic samples, museum specimens and hair or feces of free ranging animals.},

abstract = {Individual identification via non-invasive sampling is of prime importance in conservation genetics and in behavioral ecology. This approach allows for genetics studies of wild animals without having to catch them, or even to observe them. The material used as a source of DNA is usually faeces, shed hairs, or shed feathers. It has been recently shown that this material may lead to genotyping errors, mainly due to allelic dropout. In addition to these technical errors, there are problems with accurately estimating the probability of identity (PI, or the probability of two individuals having identical genotypes) because of the presence of close relatives in natural populations. As a consequence, before initiating an extensive study involving non-invasive sampling, we strongly suggest conducting a pilot stud) to assess both the technical difficulties and the PI for the genetic markers to be used. This pilot study could be carried out in three steps: (i) estimation of the PI using preliminary genetic data; (ii) simulations taking into account the PI and choosing the technical error rate that is sufficiently low for assessing the scientific question; (iii) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experiments to check if it is technically possible to achieve this error rate.

The field has grown rapidly over the past 15 years. The persistent influence of land-use history and natural disturbance on contemporary ecosystems has become apparent. Devel- opment of pattern metrics has largely stabilized, and they are widely used to relate landscape pattern to ecological responses. Analyses conducted at multiple scales have demonstrated the importance of landscape pattern for many taxa, and spatially medi- ated interspecific interactions are receiving increased attention. Disturbance remains prominent in landscape studies, and current research is addressing disturbance interac- tions. Integration of ecosystem and landscape ecology remains challenging but should enhance understanding of landscape function. Landscape ecology should continue to refine knowledge of when spatial heterogeneity is fundamentally important, rigorously test the generality of its concepts, and develop a more mechanistic understanding of the relationships between pattern and process.},

abstract = {Ecologists are familiar with two data structures commonly used to represent landscapes. Vector-based maps delineate land cover types as polygons, while raster lattices represent the landscape as a grid. Here we adopt a third lattice data structure, the graph. A graph represents a landscape as a set of nodes (e.g., habitat patches) connected to some degree by edges that join pairs of nodes functionally (e.g., via dispersal). Graph theory is well developed in other fields, including geography (transportation networks, routing applications, siting problems) and computer science (circuitry and network optimization). We present an overview of basic elements of graph theory as it might be applied to issues of connectivity in heterogeneous landscapes, focusing especially on applications of metapopulation theory in conservation biology. We develop a general set of analyses using a hypothetical landscape mosaic of habitat patches in a nonhabitat matrix. Our results suggest that a simple graph construct, the minimum spanning tree, can serve as a powerful guide to decisions about the relative importance of individual patches to overall landscape connectivity. We then apply this approach to an actual conservation scenario involving the threatened Mexican Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis lucida). Simulations with an incidence-function metapopulation model suggest that population persistence can be maintained despite substantial losses of habitat area, so long as the minimum spanning tree is protected. We believe that graph theory has considerable promise for applications concerned with connectivity and ecological flows in general. Because the theory is already well developed in other disciplines, it might be brought to bear immediately on pressing ecological applications in conservation biology and landscape ecology.},

abstract = {Research on impacts of human activity and infrastructure development on reindeer and caribou (Rangifer tarandus) is reviewed in the context of spatial (m to many km) and temporal (min to decades) scales. Before the 1980s, most disturbance studies were behavioral studies of individual animals at local scales, reporting few and short-term (min to h) impacts within 0-2 km from human activity. Around the mid 1980s, focus shifted to regional-scale landscape studies, reporting that Rangifer reduced the use of areas within 5 km from infrastructure and human activity by 50-95{\%} for weeks, months or even years and increased use of remaining undisturbed habitat far beyond those distances. The extent could vary with type of disturbance, sex, terrain, season, and sensitivity of herds. Of 85 studies reviewed, 83{\%} of the regional studies concluded that the impacts of human activity were significant, while only 13{\%} of the local studies did the same. Accurate assessment of impacts from human activity requires regional-scale studies, a pattern confirmed in a few long-term (decades) pre- and post-development studies. Such long-term studies are needed to improve understanding of both temporal and spatial patterns.},

The identification and mapping of landscape elements that may enhance functional connectivity is usually a subjective process based on visual interpretations of species movement patterns. New methods based on mathematical morphology provide a generic, flexible, and automated approach for the definition of indicators based on the classification and mapping of spatial patterns of connectivity from observed or simulated movement and dispersal events. The approach is illustrated with data derived from simulated movement on a map produced from satellite imagery of a structurally complex, multi-habitat landscape. The analysis reveals critical areas that facilitate the movement of dispersers among habitat patches.

abstract = {Abstract Most existing methods for service area delimitation are sensitive to the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) since the census data used to account for the socioeconomic context are tied to discrete census tracts. This paper presents an innovative Voronoi diagrams method – adaptive crystal-growth Voronoi diagrams based on weighted planes – to address this issue. The method uses weighted raster planes to represent continuous socioeconomic attributes. It adaptively adjusts the crystal-growth speed based on real-time results of the weight of each grown area. A case study of service area delimitation for 34 middle schools in Haizhu District of Guangzhou, China is used to demonstrate its value. The results indicate that the adaptive crystal-growth Voronoi diagrams produced superior results on addressing the socioeconomic context when compared to four other methods for delimiting service areas of public facilities. Furthermore, the method mitigates the $\backslash${\{}MAUP$\backslash${\}} since it is based on estimated continuous socioeconomic weighted planes and no arbitrary areal units are used. It is a superior tool for delimiting service areas of public facilities which are highly dependent on the distribution of socioeconomic attributes (e.g., fire stations, ambulance dispatching sites, waste recycling centres, and many others) and it is also applicable to many other fields of spatial optimization.},

abstract = {in many marine species, high levels of gene flow ensure that the genetic signal from population differentiation is weak, As a consequence, various errors associated with estimating population genetic parameters that might normally be safely ignored assume a relatively greater importance. This fact has important implications for the use of genetic data to address two common questions ire fishery conservation and management: (1) How many stocks of a given species are there? and (2) How much gene flow occurs among stocks? This article discusses strategies to maximize the signal:noise ratio in genetic studies of marine species and suggests a quantitative method to correct for bias due to a common sampling problem. For many marine species, however, genetic methods alone cannot fully resolve these key management questions because the amount of migration necessary to eliminate rarest genetic evidence of stock structure (only a handful of individuals per generation) will generally be inconsequential as a force for rebuilding depleted populations on a time scale of interest to humans, These limitations emphasize the importance of understanding the biology and life history of the target species-first, to guide design of the sampling program, and second, so that additional information can be used to supplement indirect estimates of migration rates based on genetic data.},

abstract = {We construct and explore a general modeling framework that allows for a systematic investigation of the impact of changes in landscape structure on population dynamics. The essential parts of the framework are a landscape generator with independent control over landscape composition and physiognomy, an individual-based spatially explicit population model that simulates population dynamics within heterogeneous landscapes, and scale-dependent landscape indices that depict the essential aspects of landscape that interact with dispersal and demographic processes. Landscape maps are represented by a grid of 50 x 50 cells and consist of good-quality, poor-quality. or uninhabitable matrix habitat cells. The population model was shaped in accordance to the biology of European brown bears (Ursus arctos), and demographic parameters were adjusted to yield a source-sink configuration. Results obtained with the spatially explicit model do not confirm results of earlier nonspatial source-sink models where addition of sink habitat resulted in a decrease of total population size because of dilution of high-quality habitat. Our landscape indices, which describe scale-dependent correlation between and within habitat types, were able to explain variations in variables of population dynamics (mean number of females with sink home ranges, mean number of females with source home ranges, and mean dispersal distance) caused by different landscape structure. When landscape structure changed, changes in these variables generally followed the corresponding change of an appropriate landscape index in a linear way. Our general approach incorporates source-sink dynamics as well as metapopulation dynamics, and the population model can easily be modified for other species groups.},

abstract = {Many organisms occupy heterogeneous landscapes that contain both barriers to movement as well as corridors that facilitate dispersal. The extent to which such features determine population connectivity will depend on the mechanisms utilized by organisms to disperse. Here we examined the interaction between landscape structure and dispersal in the endemic aquatic snail, Fonscochlea accepta, in the fragmented artesian spring ecosystem of arid central Australia. We used frequentist and Bayesian analyses of microsatellite data to identify population structure and immigration for 1130 snails sampled from 50 springs across an entire spring complex. We introduce a modified isolation-by-distance analysis to test hypotheses about how populations are clustered and to distinguish the most likely dispersal pathways within and between those clusters. Highly significant differences in F-ST values and significant isolation-by-distance patterns were detected among springs across the entire complex, while Bayesian assignment tests revealed the presence of two hierarchical levels of spring clustering. Clusters were defined by the spatial aggregation of springs, dynamic aquatic habitat connections between springs and the ecology of the snails. Bayesian immigrant identification and our modified isolation-by-distance analysis revealed that dispersal occurs at two geographical scales via two very different mechanisms. Short range dispersal (usually {\textless}= 300 m) occurs via active movement facilitated by aquatic connections among springs while long-range dispersal ({\textgreater}= 3 km) is likely facilitated by an animal vector (phoresy). These results underline the importance of both dispersal mode and landscape structure in influencing connectivity rates and patterns among populations.},

abstract = {The spectrum of a graph has been widely used in graph theory to characterise the properties of a graph and extract information from its structure. It has also been employed as a graph representation for pattern matching since it is invariant to the labelling of the graph. There are, however, a number of potential drawbacks in using the spectrum as a representation of a graph. Firstly, more than one graph may share the same spectrum. It is well known, for example, that very few trees can be uniquely specified by their spectrum. Secondly, the spectrum may change dramatically with a small change structure. There are a wide variety of graph matrix representations from which the spectrum can be extracted. Among these are the adjacency matrix, combinatorial Laplacian, normalised Laplacian and unsigned Laplacian. Spectra can also be derived from the heat kernel matrix and path length distribution matrix. The choice of matrix representation clearly has a large effect on the suitability of spectrum in a number of pattern recognition tasks. In this paper we investigate the performance of the spectra as a graph representation in a variety of situations. Firstly, we investigate the cospectrality of the various matrix representations over large graph and tree sets, extending the work of previous authors. We then show that the Euclidean distance between spectra tracks the edit distance between graphs over a wide range of edit costs, and we analyse the accuracy of this relationship. We then use the spectra to both cluster and classify the graphs and demonstrate the effect of the graph matrix formulation on error rates. These results are produced using both synthetic graphs and trees and graphs derived from shape and image data. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Critical thresholds are transition ranges across which small changes in spatial pattern produce abrupt shifts in ecological responses. Habitat fragmentation provides a familiar example of a critical threshold. As the landscape becomes dissected into smaller parcels of habitat, landscape connectivity-the functional linkage among habitat patches-may suddenly become disrupted, which may have important consequences for the distribution and persistence of populations. Landscape connectivity depends not only on the abundance and spatial patterning of habitat, but also on the habitat specificity and dispersal abilities of species. Habitat specialists with limited dispersal capabilities presumably have a much lower threshold to habitat fragmentation than highly vagile species, which may perceive the landscape as functionally connected across a greater range of fragmentation severity. To determine where threshold effects in species' responses to landscape structure are likely to occur, we developed a simulation model modified from percolation theory. Our simulations predicted the distributional patterns of populations in different landscape mosaics? which we tested empirically using two grasshopper species (Orthoptera: Acrididae) that occur in the shortgrass prairie of north-central Colorado. Increasing degree of habitat specialization and dispersal range of a species enhanced the level of aggregation-the degree of clumping exhibited by the population-in our simulations. The landscape threshold at which populations became aggregated was affected by dispersal range for habitat generalists, but not for habitat specialists. Habitat specialists exhibited aggregated populations when preferred habitat occupied {\textless}40{\%} of the landscape. Habitat generalists with good dispersal abilities occurred as aggregated populations when {\textless}35{\%} of the landscape contained suitable habitat; habitat generalists with limited dispersal only formed patchy distributions when the preferred habitat was a minor (20{\%}) proportion of the habitat. In field tests, a large species of grasshopper (Xanthippus corallipes Haldeman) exhibited reduced rates of travel in two microhabitats that together comprised 35{\%} of a grassland mosaic; a smaller species (Psoloessa delicatula Scudder) had the highest residence time in a rare microhabitat that occurred in only 8{\%} of the landscape. On the basis of our simulation results, we predicted that the large species would be patchily distributed because the abundance of its associated habitat is at the critical threshold. The small species should be unable to aggregate, given the rarity of habitat for which it has an affinity, and thus should be randomly distributed across the landscape. The distribution of these two species in this grassland mosaic matched the predictions from our simulations. By providing quantitative predictions of threshold effects, this modelling approach may prove useful in the formulation of conservation strategies and assessment of land-use changes on species' distributional patterns and persistence.},

abstract = {Identification of individuals in a free-ranging animal population is potentially hampered by a lack of distinguishing features (e.g., scars, unique color patterns), poor visibility (e.g., densely forested environments), cost and invasiveness of physical capture, and mark loss; Advances in DNA-analysis technology offer alternative methods of individual identification that may overcome several of these problems. We investigated the genetic variability of American black bears (Ursus americanus) and brown (grizzly) bears (Ursus arctos) in the ColumbiaRiver basin of British Columbia, Canada, and developed a method to obtain genetic samples from free-ranging bears. We established the background genetic variability using microsatellite genotyping at 9 loci using tissue and blood samples from captured bears. In 3 field trials, we tested methods to obtain hair from free-ranging bears. Although all methods collected hair suitable for DNA analysis, the barbed-wire enclosure hair-trap was superior. We extracted DNA from hair roots and identified sample species with a species-specific mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) test and sample sex from a Y-chromosome test. Using 6 microsatellite loci from nuclear DNA (nDNA), we screened all hair samples for individual identity and developed match probability functions based on scenarios of random sampling (P-random), the likely presence of parent-offspring groupings in the samples (Ppar-offs), and the likely presence of siblings in the samples (P-sib) We applied the Psib to each hair sample (match criteria at P-sib{\textless}0.05) and illustrated how these microsatellite genotypes can be used as genetic tags in mark-recapture bear censuses. The ability to identify species, sex, and individuality of free-ranging bears has numerous potential applications in field studies.},

abstract = {P{\textgreater}Sampling DNA noninvasively has advantages for identifying animals for uses such as mark-recapture modeling that require unique identification of animals in samples. Although it is possible to generate large amounts of data from noninvasive sources of DNA, a challenge is overcoming genotyping errors that can lead to incorrect identification of individuals. A major source of error is allelic dropout, which is failure of DNA amplification at one or more loci. This has the effect of heterozygous individuals being scored as homozygotes at those loci as only one allele is detected. If errors go undetected and the genotypes are naively used in mark-recapture models, significant overestimates of population size can occur. To avoid this it is common to reject low-quality samples but this may lead to the elimination of large amounts of data. It is preferable to retain these low-quality samples as they still contain usable information in the form of partial genotypes. Rather than trying to minimize error or discarding error-prone samples we model dropout in our analysis. We describe a method based on data augmentation that allows us to model data from samples that include uncertain genotypes. Application is illustrated using data from the European badger (Meles meles).},

abstract = {Landscape pattern is spatially correlated and scale-dependent. Thus, understanding landscape structure and functioning requires multiscale information, and scaling functions are the most precise and concise way of quantifying multiscale characteristics explicitly. The major objective of this study was to explore if there are any scaling relations for landscape pattern when it is measured over a range of scales (grain size and extent). The results showed that the responses of landscape metrics to changing scale fell into two categories when computed at the class level (i.e., for individual land cover types): simple scaling functions and unpredictable behavior. Similarly, three categories were found at the landscape level, with the third being staircase pattern, in a previous study when all land cover types were combined together. In general, scaling relations were more variable at the class level than at the landscape level, and more consistent and predictable with changing grain size than with changing extent at both levels. Considering that the landscapes under study were quite diverse in terms of both composition and configuration, these results seem robust. This study highlights the need for multiscale analysis in order to adequately characterize and monitor landscape heterogeneity, and provides insights into the scaling of landscape patterns.},

abstract = {Resistance surfaces are often used to fill gaps in our knowledge surrounding animal movement and are frequently the basis for modeling connectivity associated with conservation initiatives. However, the methods for quantifying resistance surfaces are varied and there is no general consensus on the appropriate choice of environmental data or analytical approaches. We provide a comprehensive review of the literature on this topic to highlight methods used and identify knowledge gaps. Our review includes 96 papers that parameterized resistance surfaces (sometimes using multiple approaches) for a variety of taxa. Data types used included expert opinion (n = 76), detection (n = 23), relocation (n = 8), pathway (n = 2), and genetic (n = 28). We organized the papers into three main analytical approaches; one-stage expert opinion, one-stage empirical, and two-stage empirical, each of which was represented by 43, 22, and 36 papers, respectively. We further organized the empir- ical approaches into five main resource selection functions; point (n = 16), matrix (n = 38), home range (n = 3), step (n = 1), and pathway (n = 1).We found a general lack of justification for choice of environmental variables and their thematic and spatial representation, a heavy reliance on expert opinion and detection data, and a tendency to confound movement behavior and resource use. Future research needs include comparative analyses on the choice of envi- ronmental variables and their spatial and thematic scales, and on the various biological data types used to estimate resistance. Comparative analyses amongst analytical processes is also needed, as well as trans- parency in reporting on uncertainty in parameter estimates and sensitivity of final resistance surfaces, especially if the resistance surfaces are to be used for conservation and planning purposes},
